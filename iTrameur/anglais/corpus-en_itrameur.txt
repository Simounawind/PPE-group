Why Does Racial Inequality Persist?Culture, Causation, and Responsibility

Racial Inequality: A Conceptual Framework

   Over the last 40 years, I've explored why, notwithstanding the success
   of the civil rights movement, the subordinate status of
   African-Americans persists. Key to my thinking about this intractable
   problem has been the need to distinguish the role played by
   discrimination against black people from that played by
   counterproductive behavioral patterns among blacks.

   This puts what is a very sensitive issue rather starkly. Many vocal
   advocates for racial equality have been loath to consider the
   possibility that problematic patterns of behavior could be an important
   factor contributing to our persisting disadvantaged status. Some
   observers on the right of American politics, meanwhile, take the
   position that discrimination against blacks is no longer an important
   determinant of unequal social outcomes. I have long tried to chart a
   middle course--acknowledging antiblack biases that should be remedied
   while insisting on addressing and reversing the patterns of behavior
   that impede black people from seizing newly opened opportunities to
   prosper. I still see this as the most sensible position.

   These two positions can be recast as causal narratives. One is what I
   call the "bias narrative": racism and white supremacy have done us
   wrong; we can't get ahead until they relent; so we must continue urging
   the reform of white American society toward that end.

   The other is what I call the "development narrative," according to
   which it is essential to consider how a person comes to acquire those
   skills, traits, habits, and orientations that foster successful
   participation in American society. To the extent that African-American
   youngsters do not have the experiences, are not exposed to the
   influences, and do not benefit from the resources that foster and
   facilitate their human development, they fail to achieve their full
   human potential. This lack of development is what ultimately causes the
   persistent, stark racial disparities in income, wealth, education,
   family structure, and much else. (The charts and tables on this and the
   next several pages offer a glimpse of the magnitude of these
   disparities.)

   In terms of prescribing intervention and remedy, these causal
   narratives point in very different directions. The bias narrative says
   that we need to have a "conversation" about race: white America must
   reform itself; racism must end; we need more of this or that, whatever
   the "this" or "that" is on the agenda of today's race reformers. One
   hears this kind of talk, one reads these exhortations, in newspapers
   and other media every day.

   The development narrative puts more onus on the responsibilities of
   African-Americans to develop our human potential. It is not satisfied
   with wishful thinking like: "If we could only double the budget for
   some social program, the homicide rate among young African-American men
   would be less atrocious." Or, "If we can just get this police
   department investigated by the Department of Justice, then...." The
   development narrative asks, Then what? Then it will be safe to walk on
   the south side of Chicago after midnight?

   Meanwhile, the terms themselves--race and discrimination--are often
   bandied about without being rigorously defined. In a 2002 book, The
   Anatomy of Racial Inequality, I sketched a theory of race applicable to
   the social and historical circumstances of the U.S., speculated about
   why racial inequalities persist, and advanced a conceptual framework
   for thinking about social justice in matters of race.[[150]1] Because
   there remains so much confusion in today's public discussions about
   race and racial inequality, I need to revisit that framework. Bear with
   me. The relevance of this conceptual excursion will be clear soon
   enough.

Categorization Versus Signification

   For me, the term "race" refers to indelible and heritable marks on
   human bodies--skin color, hair texture, bone structure--that are of no
   intrinsic significance but that nevertheless have, through time, come
   to be invested with social expectations that are more or less
   reasonable and social meanings that are more or less durable. When we
   talk about race in America or anywhere else, we are actually dealing
   with two distinct processes: categorization and signification.
   Categorization entails sorting people into a small number of subsets
   based on bodily marks and differentiating one's dealings with such
   persons accordingly. It is a cognitive act--an effort to comprehend the
   social world around us.

   Signification is an interpretative act--one that associates certain
   connotations or "social meanings" with those categories. Informational
   and symbolic issues are both at play. Or, as I like to put it, when we
   speak about race, we are really talking about "embodied social
   signification."[[151]2]

   It is instructive to contrast a social-cognitive conception of race
   with acts of biological taxonomy--sorting humans based on presumed
   variations of genetic endowments across what had for eons been
   geographically isolated subpopulations. Such isolation was, until
   recently, the human condition, and it may be thought to have led to the
   emergence of distinct races. Nevertheless, using the term "race" in
   this way is controversial, particularly if the aim is to explain social
   inequalities between groups.

   Thus, scientists, such as the population geneticist Luigi
   Cavalli-Sforza,[[152]3] and social critics, such as the philosopher
   Anthony Appiah,[[153]4] deny that "race" refers to anything real. What
   they have in mind is the biological-taxonomic notion, and what they
   deny is that meaningful distinctions among human subgroups pertinent to
   accounting for racial inequality can be derived from this notion. I am
   not arguing this point--though it would appear to be eminently
   arguable. What I am emphasizing is that to establish the scientific
   invalidity of race demonstrates neither the irrationality nor the
   immorality of invoking racial classification as acts of social
   cognition. So I shall employ the concept of race here, with an emphasis
   on the negative interpretative/symbolic connotations attached to
   "blackness" in the U.S.[[154]5]

Reward Bias Versus Development Bias

   Given this theoretical understanding of race, what might one say about
   the causes of persistent racial inequality? Fundamental is the
   elemental distinction I first drew in 2002 between racial
   discrimination and racial stigma. Discrimination is about how blacks
   are treated; stigma is about how blacks are perceived.

   What I call "reward bias" (conventional racialdiscrimination) is now a
   less significant barrier to the full participation of African-Americans
   in U.S. society than what I call "development bias." Reward bias
   focuses on the disadvantageous treatment of black people in formal
   transactions that limits their rewards for skills and talents presented
   to the market. Development bias refers to impediments that block access
   for black people to those resources necessary to develop and refine
   their talents but that are conveyed via informal social relations. This
   is where the consideration of culture enters the picture.

   Reward bias is grounded in racially discriminatory transactions, but
   development bias is ultimately rooted in racially stigmatized social
   relations. Many resources that foster human development only become
   available to persons as the by-product of informal, race-influenced
   social interactions. Another way to put this expanded view of
   discrimination: reward bias reflects discrimination in contract while
   development bias reflects discrimination in contact.

   Obviously, these two forms of bias are not mutually exclusive. The
   acquisition of skills can be blocked by overt discriminatory treatment,
   and a regime of market discrimination under pressure from the forces of
   economic competition may require informal instruments of social control
   to maintain that discriminatory regime.[[155]6] Though both kinds of
   bias promote racial inequality, the distinction is useful.

   The moral problem presented by reward bias is straightforward and calls
   for an uncontroversial remedy: laws against overt racial
   discrimination. Development bias presents a subtler and more insidious
   ethical challenge that may be difficult to remedy via public policies
   in any way that garners majoritarian support. Ultimately, development
   bias deals with some cultural patterns that are characteristic of both
   a racial minority group and the society at large, while reward bias
   deals with overt antiblack discriminatory treatment that, even though
   it has not been fully eliminated, is nevertheless nearly universally
   condemned.

   The difficulties for remedying development bias have a cognitive and an
   ethical dimension. In terms of cognition, when confronted with a racial
   group's poor social performance, an observer may be unable to
   distinguish between blocked developmental opportunities and limited
   capacities or distorted values. In ethical terms, citizens who find the
   "transactional discrimination" associated with reward bias to be
   noxious may be less offended by the covert, subconscious "relational
   discrimination" that underlies development bias.[[156]7]

   Regarding the distinction between reward bias and development bias: to
   understand persistent racial inequality in America, it is crucial to
   put relations before transactions. The focus on discriminatory economic
   transactions may not be sufficient; one will need also to consider the
   consequences of racially stigmatized social relations. Stigma--the
   distorted social meanings attaching to "blackness"--inhibits the access
   that some black people have to those networks of social affiliation
   where developmental resources are most readily appropriated. This might
   happen because black people are socially excluded; it might also happen
   because we choose to be socially withdrawn.

   On this view, persistent inequality may no longer be due mainly to a
   racially discriminatory marketplace, or an administrative state that
   refuses to reward black talent equally, as was the case in decades
   past. Rather, today's problem may be due, in large part, to a
   race-tinged psychology of perception and valuation--a way of seeing
   black people, and a way of black people seeing themselves, that impedes
   the acquisition of traits that are valued in the marketplace and are
   essential for human development.

   This can lead to a vicious circle. The status of a racial group as
   stigmatized in the social imagination--and crucially, in its own
   self-understanding--can be rationalized and socially reproduced because
   of that group's subordinate position in the economic order. Moreover,
   this way of thinking implies that the explanatory categories of "racial
   discrimination" and "racially distinct behaviors" are not mutually
   exclusive.

Social Capital Versus Human Capital

   A quarter-century before the publication of The Anatomy of Racial
   Inequality, I coined the term "social capital" to help account for
   persistent racial inequality in the U.S.[[157]8] The concept behind
   social capital illuminates the difference between informal social
   relations and formal economic transactions--between reward and
   development bias--as mechanisms perpetuating the subordinate position
   of African-Americans.

   As an economist, I sought to differentiate social capital with the more
   familiar term in my own field: "human capital." Human-capital theory
   attempts to account for variation in people's earnings capacities by
   analogy with well-developed theories of investment. These theories
   begin with the assumption of competitive markets and rational choice by
   forward-looking individuals, and then analyze investment decisions in
   light of individuals' time preferences, their anticipated rates of
   return, and the available alternatives for uses of their time.
   Human-capital theory imports into the study of human inequality an
   intellectual framework that had been well developed in economics to
   explain the investment decisions of firms--a framework that focuses on
   the analysis of formal economic transactions.

   I argued that associating business with human investments is merely an
   analogy, not an identity--particularly if one seeks to explain
   persistent racial disparities. Human capital, as an economic concept,
   overlooks two important facts having to do with informal social
   relations.

   First, all human development is socially situated and mediated. Human
   development takes place between people, by way of human interactions,
   within social institutions--the family, the community, the school, the
   peer group. Many resources essential to human development, such as the
   attention that parents give to their children, are not alienable. These
   resources, for the most part, are not commodities and are not up for
   sale. Instead, structured connections between individuals create the
   context within which developmental resources come to be allocated to
   individual persons. Opportunity travels along the synapses of these
   social networks.

   The resulting allocation of developmental resources need not be
   responsive to prices or be economically efficient. The development of
   human beings is not the same as corporate investment, and it is not a
   good metaphor, or a good analogy, to reason as though this were so.

   Human development begins before birth. The decisions a mother
   makes--about how closely to attend to her health and nutrition during
   pregnancy, for instance--will alter the neurological development of her
   fetus. This, and a myriad of other decisions and actions, all come
   together to shape the experience of the infant, who will mature one day
   to become a human being, and about whom it will be said that he or she
   has this or that much productivity, as reflected in his or her wages or
   academic test scores.

   This productivity, the behavioral and cognitive capacities bearing on a
   person's social and economic functioning, are not merely the result of
   a mechanical infusion of material resources. Rather, these are
   by-products of social processes mediated by networks of human
   affiliation, and these processes are fundamentally important for
   understanding persistent racial disparities.

   Second, what we call "race" is mainly a social, and only indirectly a
   biological, phenomenon. The persistence across generations of racial
   differentiation between large groups of people, in an open society
   where individuals live in proximity to one another, provides
   irrefutable indirect evidence of a profound separation between the
   racially defined networks of social affiliation within that society.
   There would be no races in the steady state of any dynamic social
   system unless, on a daily basis and with regard to their most intimate
   affairs, people paid assiduous attention to the boundaries separating
   themselves from racially distinct others. Over time, race would cease
   to exist unless people chose to act in a manner so as biologically to
   reproduce the variety of phenotypic expression that constitutes the
   substance of racial distinction.

   If the goal is to understand durable racial inequality in a society,
   one needs to attend in detail to the processes that cause race to
   persist as a fact of life, because such processes will be related to
   the allocation of human developmental resources in that society.

   Race, as a feature of a society, rests upon the cultural conceptions
   about identity held by the people--in America, principally blacks and
   whites alike--in that society. These are the beliefs that people hold
   about who they are and about the legitimacy of conducting intimate
   relations (and not only sexual relations) with racially distinct
   others. Beliefs of this kind affect the access that people enjoy to
   those informal resources that individuals require to develop their
   human potential. Social capital is a critical prerequisite for creating
   what economists refer to as human capital.

   Any conceptual framework for the study of persistent racial inequality
   is incomplete if it fails to consider the interactions between those
   social processes ensuring the reproduction of racial difference, on one
   hand, and those processes facilitating human development, on the other
   hand. If we consider these interactions, it becomes easier to see the
   many intimate connections between the antiblack "racial bias" that
   liberals emphasize and the "behavioral pathology" of (some) blacks that
   (some) conservatives are so keen to focus on.

Nobody Is Coming to Save Us

   I know how difficult it can be to see those connections--it has taken
   me many years to recognize them. My doctoral dissertation included an
   essay that was very close to the liberal, "racial bias" narrative.
   History, I wrote, casts a long shadow. Contemporary racial inequality
   in America reflects a history of deprivation, discrimination, and
   dispossession of black people. We can't expect this problem to cure
   itself. Thus, social justice rightly understood would involve some kind
   of reparation. I didn't use that word, but I did advocate for some
   intervention by the state on behalf of the explicit goal of racial
   equality. Otherwise, I reasoned, we would be stuck indefinitely with
   the consequences of an unjust past.[[158]9]

   That was Glenn Loury circa 1976. By 1985, I had become a Reagan
   Republican, emphasizing the problems of single-parent families,
   out-of-wedlock births among blacks, low labor-force participation and
   educational performance, and high criminal and victimization rates. My
   favored formulation: there is an enemy without--namely, racism; but
   there is also an enemy within--namely, behavior patterns inhibiting
   African-Americans from seizing such opportunities as had come to exist.
   I stressed to other blacks that if we were ever to achieve equality
   within American society, we could not simply rely on the
   antidiscrimination laws and affirmative action; we would also have to
   address some of these internal behavioral patterns. I still believe
   this to be the case.

   By pointing to the "enemy within," I did not deny that the ultimate
   source of such adverse internal patterns might be historical
   discrimination. (Although as a social scientist, I recognized that this
   kind of causal inference question is nearly impossible to resolve
   convincingly by looking at data.) But it did not matter so much what
   the ultimate sources of internal behavioral patterns were; what
   mattered was how they were to be reversed.

   The majority of African-American children are born to a woman without a
   husband. It is extremely implausible to imagine how this would be
   reversed by government policies such as the redistribution of
   resources. (I am aware of no evidence to this effect.) If this trend is
   to be reversed at all, it would require a determined effort by
   African-Americans to think differently about our responsibilities to
   our children and to one another.

   And so I would say to fellow African-Americans: No one is coming to
   save us! The situation in which we find ourselves is unfair, but this
   is not a question of justice. Nobody is coming, and, more
   fundamentally, no one can come into the most intimate relations between
   our women and men, into the families and neighborhoods where our
   children are being raised, so as to reorder those cultural institutions
   in a manner that would be more developmentally constructive.

   These matters are ultimately and necessarily in the hands of
   African-Americans alone. They require facing up to such questions as:
   Who are we as a people? How should we live with one another? What will
   we do to honor the sacrifices that our ancestors made to leave us the
   opportunities we now enjoy? What do we owe our children?

   Think about black-on-black crime. Unemployment rates, wealth holdings,
   residential segregation, and biased policing all may be playing some
   role in this problem. But young black men are killing one another at
   extraordinary rates. Notwithstanding the potential beneficial effects
   of various social policies, no one is coming to save black people from
   that pathology. If we are not prepared to condemn this contemptible
   behavior and to cooperate with institutions of civil authority that are
   legitimately addressing it--if we are unable to recognize that this is
   a tragic failure with the way that black people are living--we will
   likely be facing exactly the same issues for many years to come.

"Bias Narratives" Can Take on (Viral) Lives of Their Own

   Today, as social-justice warriors take to the streets to protest
   against racism, it is important to recognize the role played by
   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media. Many people get
   news from online sources that play to the narrative that American
   society is overwhelmingly populated by white bigots; so incidents that
   are not at all representative nevertheless become iconic because they
   go viral. A student finds something resembling a noose near his
   dorm-room door; a security guard says to someone, "I am unsure whether
   you belong here. Let me see your ID"; customers are asked to leave a
   food-service establishment when the manager thinks that their behavior
   is inconsistent with the establishment's rules. These incidents become
   national events. It is not simply that something has happened, or that
   a lot of people know about something having happened. Rather, what
   matters is that a lot of people know that many people know of the
   incidents in question.

   Idiosyncratic occurrences then become "driving while black,"
   "barbecuing while black," "swimming while black," "shopping while
   black," "walking while black," and so forth. The narrative of pervasive
   antiblack racism becomes a trope. When millions of people focus on the
   same events and reinforce one another in their comments, declaring
   one's outrage at such incidents becomes a substitute for reasoning
   about what larger meaning, if any, should be attached to these events.

   I often ask people who tell me about these incidents: Why do we care?
   Why should I care whether a woman was asked to put out her cigarette
   when a police officer stopped her for a broken taillight on a dusty
   road in Texas? Is that supposed to be emblematic of the treatment of
   black people in this country?

   As a social scientist, I am loath to operate based on a few anecdotes.
   For many who embrace the bias narrative, however, that's what is
   happening. Incidents that are not representative but that are salient
   within a bias narrative go viral and shape the consciousness of many.
   The viral social construction of episodes that are not the substance of
   our lives comes to shape our politics via exaggerated projections onto
   the surface of our lives. This is not "politics"--if, by that term, we
   understand mechanisms of give-and-take and persuasion by means of which
   we govern ourselves. It is, rather, a certain kind of mass delusion.

   A big part of the problem is virtue signaling. Only certain kinds of
   (immoral) people would refuse to go along with these delusions, and too
   many of us wish not to be thought of as being one of those people, so
   we avoid expressing skepticism publicly. To do so--to repeat things
   being said by those who scoff at the outrage of the day and are thought
   to be racists--risks devaluing one's reputation among "progressives."

   My theory of political correctness: a cognitive and intellectual dead
   end where too many people are motivated to remain silent on critical
   questions, to voice empty platitudes, or even to say things that they
   don't believe, all by their need to avoid appearing as though they're
   on the wrong side of history.[[159]10]

Those Who Downplay Behavioral Disparities Are Bluffing

   People on the left of American politics who claim that "white
   supremacy," "implicit bias," and old-fashioned discrimination account
   for black disadvantage are daring you to disagree. Their implicit
   rebuke is that, if you do not agree, you are saying that there's
   something intrinsically wrong with black people, or with black culture;
   you must be a racist who thinks that blacks are inferior. Otherwise,
   they say, how else could one explain the disparities? Behavior? That
   leads to the accusation that you are "blaming the victim."

   But this is a bluff. It is a rhetorical sleight-of-hand, a debater's
   trick. Why? Consider a statement that "mass incarceration," the high
   number of blacks in jails and prisons, is self-evidently a sign of
   American racism. If you respond that it's mainly a sign of the
   pathological behavior of criminals who happen to be black, you risk
   being called a racist. Yet common sense, not to mention the evidence,
   suggests that people are not being arrested, tried, convicted, and
   sentenced because they are black. Rather, prisons are full of people
   who have broken the law, who have hurt other people, who have violated
   the basic rules of civility. Prison is not a conspiracy to confine
   black people. I maintain that no serious person believes that it is.
   Not really.

   The young black men taking one another's lives on the streets of St.
   Louis, Baltimore, and Chicago are exhibiting behavioral pathology,
   plain and simple. The people they kill are mainly black, and the
   families who live with the misery are mainly black. Ascribing that to
   white racism is laughable. Nobody believes it. Not really.

   Consider educational test-score data. Antiracism advocates are, in
   effect, daring you to say that some groups send their children to the
   elite universities in outsize numbers compared with other groups
   because their academic preparation is magnitudes higher and better.
   Such excellence is an achievement.[[160]11]

   One is not born with the knowledge, skills, and academic ability to
   gain admission into elite colleges. The people who acquire these skills
   do so through effort. Why do some youngsters acquire the skills while
   others do not? That is a deep question requiring a serious answer. The
   simple answer--that this disparity is due to racism, and anyone who
   says otherwise is a racist--is not serious. Do such disparate outcomes
   have nothing to do with behavior, with cultural patterns, with what
   peer groups value, with how people spend their time, with what they
   identify as being critical to their self-respect? Anyone who believes
   that is, at best, a fool.

   Asians are said, sardonically, to be a "model minority." As a matter of
   fact, quite a compelling case can be made that "culture" is critical to
   their success. Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou interviewed Asian families in
   Southern California, trying to learn how their kids get into Dartmouth,
   Columbia, and Cornell at such high rates.[[161]12] They found that
   these families do exhibit cultural patterns, embrace values, adopt
   practices, engage in behavior, and follow disciplines that orient them
   so as to facilitate the achievements of their children. It defies
   common sense, as well as the evidence, to assert that they do not, or,
   conversely, to assert that the paucity of African-Americans performing
   at the very top of the intellectual spectrum--I am talking about
   academic excellence and about the low relative numbers of blacks who
   exhibit it--has nothing to do with behavior, that it is due entirely to
   institutional forces. That is an absurdity.

   Some 70% of African-American babies are born to a woman without a
   husband. Is this a good thing? Is it due to the ongoing practice of
   antiblack racism? Some people say these things. Do they really believe
   these things, or are they daring you to deny them?

   The 21st-century failures of too many African-Americans to take
   advantage of the opportunities created by the civil rights revolution
   are palpable, yet they are denied at every turn. This position is
   untenable. The end of Jim Crow segregation and the advent of equal
   rights for blacks were game changers. A half-century later, the deep
   disparities that remain are shameful and are due in large part to the
   behaviors of black people.

   People tout the racial wealth gap as, ipso facto, an indictment of the
   system--even while black Caribbean and African immigrants are starting
   businesses, penetrating the professions, and presenting themselves at
   Ivy League institutions in outsize numbers. They are behaving, although
   black, like other immigrant groups in our nation's past. True, they are
   immigrants, not natives, and immigration can be positively selectived.
   But something is dreadfully wrong when adverse patterns of behavior
   readily visible in the black American population go without being
   adequately discussed--to the point that anybody daring to mention them
   is labeled a racist.

   Thus, the Obama administration's Department of Education issued a "Dear
   Colleague Letter"[[162]13] that sought to cajole local school districts
   around the country to narrow the racial disparity in the suspension
   rates of students for disruptive behavior. The letter was supposedly
   advice--but failure to narrow the disparity meant that the district
   could be found guilty of a civil rights violation and potentially lose
   federal funding. Trump's secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, rescinded
   that letter--resulting in a great deal of consternation.

   Of course, if teachers, principals, guidance counselors, and
   school-based police officers are discriminating by race when they
   discipline students, the Department of Education and the Department of
   Justice should get involved. But based on all that we know--for
   instance, about crime and incarceration rates--it is at least plausible
   that there is an objective racial disparity in the frequency of
   disruptive behavior that occasions a difference in the suspension
   statistics. If behavior, not racism, is at the bottom of racially
   disparate suspension rates, think of the disservice being done--to the
   schoolchildren who act out (by failing to teach the lesson that bad
   behavior has consequences), to classmates (including, of course,
   minority students) who are hindered from getting an education by
   disruptive classroom behavior, and to teachers, who are trying to
   maintain a safe environment for learning.

   One more example of how this bluffing can do harm: the
   affirmative-action debate. We are now on the verge of permanently
   including African-Americans in elite and selective academic
   institutions through an openly acknowledged use of different standards.
   That is horrible--and not because of the Fourteenth Amendment, though
   the Supreme Court may yet find it so. It's horrible because this is not
   equality. It is patronizing. It is horrible for black Americans to
   embrace, and the establishment to adopt, a set of practices rooted in
   the soft bigotry of low expectations. Yet other than Clarence Thomas,
   Thomas Sowell, and a few others, there is not even a debate among
   African-Americans about what should be a first-order question, if the
   goal is to attain genuine racial equality.

No Responsibility Means No Glory

   If the negative cultural patterns in some African-American communities
   are said to be a necessary consequence of oppression, what is one to
   make of positive cultural patterns of behavior? Are they, too, a
   necessary consequence of oppression? If an individual or a community
   refuses to take responsibility for failure, how can they claim any
   glory for success? No blame? No skin in the game? Then no credit.

   You cannot help the hand you are dealt; but you can decide how to play
   it. To cast oneself as a helpless victim, to filter experience
   constantly and at every instance through a sieve that catches
   everything that one has control over while leaving the outcome to
   invisible, implacable historical forces: something is pathetic about
   that posture.

   The struggle for equal rights for black people, from abolition through
   the civil rights movement, has always been thought of as a "freedom
   struggle." But with freedom, rightly understood, comes responsibility.
   It is past time for all of us to start performing without a net. Rather
   than lamenting the lack of black billionaires, an outcome ascribed to
   some invisible force called "racism," one can admit that you will never
   become a billionaire unless you build a billion-dollar business--which
   begins by starting a business. One will never win a Nobel Prize in
   physics unless one learns calculus at the age of 12. What black parents
   are insisting that their 12-year-old kids learn calculus--those few
   kids capable of doing so? White people are not responsible for the fact
   that black people are, or are not, doing this.

Not All Black People Are the Same

   All this having been said about the behavioral roots of racial
   inequality, it is dangerous to talk about "black culture" as if it were
   only one thing--with pathological behavior (such as high levels of
   urban violence) becoming a stereotype about all black people. Here an
   insight by UCLA sociologist Rogers Brubaker is crucial for
   understanding race and inequality: one should never invoke racial
   aggregates as the subjects of social analysis unreflectively.[[163]14]

   This is a major concern among African-Americans about "culture talk."
   Culture talk overly focuses on pathology; but many positive things
   could be mentioned that will not typically appear in an op-ed. Black
   people are not a this or a that. They are a population in excess of 30
   million, with cultural patterns as variegated as one would expect in
   such a large aggregation.

   Moreover, American society is a polyglot mixture where cultural
   dynamics influence one another. For example, some middle-class,
   suburban white kids download rap music produced by black artists from
   the inner city. These musicians come to have a market substantially
   influenced by the preferences of their middle-class white customers. To
   a certain degree, they play to that audience, including that audience's
   stereotypes about thuggish behavior. Along comes a schoolteacher who
   announces: "Rap music is bad, and it's pathological. Can't you see just
   how troubled black people are?" This is ludicrous--how is it that a few
   hundred musicians and artists responding to a national market
   consisting mostly of white customers suddenly become emblematic of
   black culture or black people?

   Another example involves the drug trade, which in the U.S. is worth
   billions of dollars annually and includes marijuana, heroin, cocaine,
   ecstasy, and crystal meth. It involves people of every race in every
   geographic location and every walk of life. But the street trafficking
   in drugs in large urban areas is largely in the hands of black and
   Latino youth--in substantial part because the only people who would do
   such dangerous, low-paying work are those whose alternative employment
   opportunities are scant. It is no surprise that those incarcerated for
   street-level trafficking are disproportionately blacks. Their arrests
   and imprisonment are not in themselves evidence of racism--or evidence
   of black culture. But given the bare facts of racial stigma in American
   society, many observers will be inclined to think so.

We're All in This Together--at Least We're Supposed to Be

   This point about racial stigma is fundamental. Without understanding
   it, one might say (as many conservative commentators do), "Look at
   recent immigrants from Asia and even from Latin America. They, too,
   have been victims in various ways. Yet they have advanced in our
   society even as the blacks of inner-city Detroit, Chicago,
   Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Oakland continue
   to lag. Whatever is wrong with those people?" In effect: "It must be
   something about `those people,' not about us, that causes them to be so
   backward."

   By looking at America this way, one eschews social, political, and
   moral responsibility for the plight of those people. One will conclude
   that blacks' failure to develop their human potential reflects the
   absence of such potential (and there are books making that argument),
   or it reflects a backward culture that, sadly but inevitably ("What
   more can we do?") causes them to lag behind. Yet blacks are not the
   authors of the stigma that engenders developmental bias against them.
   When we understand that the way people come to value things or make
   decisions is partly created via interactions in society, their
   flourishing, or lack thereof, reflects on society as a whole, as well
   as on themselves. It reflects on an "us," not merely on "them."

   The mistake is to ignore the extent to which racial inequality reflects
   not only cultural patterns among insular groups of people but also the
   interactions that run through society. To impute a causal role to what
   one takes to be intrinsic cultural traits of a subordinate racial
   group, while failing to see the systemwide context out of which
   dysfunctional cultural patterns emerged, is to commit a significant
   error of social cognition. That members of a particular group seem to
   perform less well routinely on a set of transactions of interest is a
   matter not of a cultural essence but of the network of social relations
   that has (or has not) prepared the members of that group for those
   transactions.

   In the U.S. context, "blackness" is associated with stigmatizing
   meanings. This stigma leads nonblack people to be reluctant to enter
   into intimate social or individual relations with them, which in turn
   affects the social allocation of developmental resources.

   People don't make social judgments based on straightforward
   benefit-cost calculations. Rather, they often act on identity
   considerations. They ask such questions as: Who am I? How should I
   live? With whom should I associate? When should I extend to this
   "other" a benefit of the doubt? Racial inequality is, in substantial
   part, the outcome of a system of nonmarket social interactions such as
   these that entangle us together.

   Consider the high out-of-wedlock birthrates among blacks. This pattern
   of behavior has consequences for socioeconomic racial disparities. But
   that is not the whole story.

   Racial intermarriage rates in the U.S. remain quite low (though they
   have risen in recent decades).[[164]15] The reasons for this low rate
   are unclear. Are black women, perhaps, receiving marriage proposals
   from white men and turning them down? I don't know. But I strongly
   suspect that a low rate of cross-boundary mating between these two
   groups has implications for human development, for resources available
   to children, and for the generation and transmission of wealth.

   Moreover, the low rate of intermarriage has implications for the dating
   and mating market among blacks because they are a small minority of the
   population--roughly one in eight Americans. If white men and black
   women were marrying at a higher rate, black men and black women would
   be interacting in a different way. To observe a social equilibrium in
   which blacks and whites exhibit different out-of-wedlock birthrates
   and, on the basis of that observation, to impute the difference to
   something called black culture, reflects one's failure to see how the
   intra-racial marriage market is nested within a larger context, where a
   higher rate of cross-boundary mating could substantially alter
   intra-boundary behavior.

   What may be perceived as a characteristic of "those people" (Why don't
   they marry? Why do they bear their children in such a disorderly
   manner?) might be seen instead as a question about society as a whole.
   From the perspective of the white population, perhaps the real question
   about out-of-wedlock births is: "Why do we avoid intimacy with them?" I
   use "us," "we," "them" to emphasize how stigma operates. It operates in
   the very definition of who one understands to be the social "we."

   How a society answers the question, "Who are we?" has far-reaching
   implications. When Americans talk about crime, violence, school
   failure, and urban decay, do we understand these matters as "us versus
   them"? If so, it becomes possible to say, regarding people languishing
   in the ghettos of our great cities: "That's not my country. That's some
   third-world thing."

   This was actually said during the flood of New Orleans that followed
   Hurricane Katrina. But black people have been in New Orleans for 250
   years. They're not aliens. They're as American as anybody can be. That
   was us crawling up on the rooftops. That was us huddled in the
   Superdome. The abject poverty that was exposed to a national audience
   after the flood was a quintessentially American affair, not simply a
   measure of the inadequacy of black culture. It reflected as well upon
   our social inadequacy.

   The perspective I am promoting about social capital does not require
   special, race-targeted social policy. Most policy initiatives aimed at
   improving the lives of our most disadvantaged citizens should not, and
   need not, be formulated in explicitly racial terms or understood as a
   remedy for racial injuries. We have to find what works for
   disadvantaged people in America, period. If we get that right--if we
   can fashion an American welfare state consistent with our demographic
   realities, our own values, and our fiscal capacities--we will go a very
   long way toward assisting African-Americans to develop their full human
   potential.

   Finding what works is especially pertinent for education policy.
   Disadvantaged youngsters who live in large cities are poorly served by
   the majority-minority school districts on which they and their parents
   must rely. This is a huge area for policy innovation, with respect to
   charter schools and increased options for parents. Yet black
   politicians who speak publicly on the issue are virtually unanimous in
   adopting the hostility toward charter schools that animates the
   country's largest teachers' union, the National Education Association.
   Thus, at the NAACP's annual board meeting in Cincinnati in 2016,
   delegates were overwhelmed by black American parents who had stormed
   the meeting to protest that the organization's board was about to
   endorse a resolution that opposed more funding for charter schools in
   various states.[[165]16]

   Are police good or bad for the security and safety of black lives in
   U.S. cities? It is hard to imagine a more important question. Yet one
   is hard-pressed to find any effective political debate among
   African-Americans. Instead, we get the shopworn and ineffective stances
   that people on the left are taking.

   Social-justice warriors are supposed to care about black lives. But if
   they did, they'd seriously care about securing the safety and property
   of African-Americans in the South Bronx, the west side of Chicago, and
   other cities. A real argument is to be had over public safety and the
   role of the police, and the answers are far from self-evident. Yet I'm
   not sure that social-justice warriors care about black lives. They seem
   to care more about remaining in lockstep with fashionable liberal
   opinion.

Conclusion: Who Are We?

   How should we think about the persistence of racial inequality in
   America? To deny the relevance of behavioral patterns among some black
   families and communities is folly. To wash one's hands of their
   problems because of such cultural and behavioral impediments is
   profoundly unjust. There are no easy answers, but I suggest that the
   view here is worth considering as a way to account for, and then
   respond to, an enduring dilemma that confronts and frustrates us still.

   Take the poor central-city dwellers who make up perhaps a quarter of
   the African-American population. The dysfunctional behavior of many in
   this population does account for much of their failure to progress--and
   conservatives' demand for greater personal responsibility is necessary
   and proper. Yet, confronted with the despair, violence, and
   self-destructive behavior of so many people, it seems morally
   superficial in the extreme to argue, as many conservatives do, that
   "those people should just get their acts together; if they did, like
   many of the poor immigrants, we would not have such a horrific problem
   in our cities." To the contrary, any morally astute response to the
   social pathology of American history's losers would have to conclude
   that, while we cannot change our ignoble past, we must not be
   indifferent to contemporary suffering issuing directly from that past.
   Their culture may be implicated in their difficulties, but so is our
   culture complicit in their troubles; we bear collective responsibility
   for the form and texture of our social relations.

   While we cannot ignore the behavioral problems of the so-called black
   underclass, we should discuss and react to those problems as if we were
   talking about our own children, neighbors, and friends. It will require
   adjusting ways of thinking on both sides of the racial divide.
   Achieving a well-ordered society, where all members are embraced as
   being among us, should be the goal. Our failure to do so is an American
   tragedy. It is a national, not merely a communal, disgrace. Changing
   the definition of the American "we" is a first step toward rectifying
   the relational discrimination that afflicts our society, and it is the
   best path forward in reducing racial inequality.

Abstract

   There is no safe level of exposure to inorganic arsenic or uranium, yet
   recent studies identified sociodemographic and regional inequalities in
   concentrations of these frequently detected contaminants in public
   water systems across the US. We analyze the county-level association
   between racial/ethnic composition and public water arsenic and uranium
   concentrations from 2000-2011 using geospatial models. We find that
   higher proportions of Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Alaskan
   Native residents are associated with significantly higher arsenic and
   uranium concentrations. These associations differ in magnitude and
   direction across regions; higher proportions of non-Hispanic Black
   residents are associated with higher arsenic and uranium in regions
   where concentrations of these contaminants are high. The findings from
   this nationwide geospatial analysis identifying racial/ethnic
   inequalities in arsenic and uranium concentrations in public drinking
   water across the US can advance environmental justice initiatives by
   informing regulatory action and financial and technical support to
   protect communities of color.

Introduction

   In some US populations, drinking water is a significant source of
   exposure to inorganic arsenic and uranium, which are major
   environmental exposures associated with cancer, cardiovascular disease
   and other adverse health outcomes^[61]1,[62]2,[63]3,[64]4,[65]5,[66]6.
   Inorganic arsenic (a metalloid) is a known human carcinogen, is
   consistently ranked number one on the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's
   (ATSDR) Substance Priority List^[67]7, and is also associated with
   adverse birth outcomes, diabetes, metabolic disease, and cardiovascular
   disease, even at low- to moderate- levels of exposure common in the US
   population^[68]1,[69]3,[70]4,[71]8. While alpha radiation from uranium
   decay is classified as carcinogenic, growing epidemiologic evidence
   also indicates that uranium exposure is associated with chronic kidney
   disease and is toxic to the respiratory, neurologic, and reproductive
   systems^[72]2,[73]6,[74]9,[75]10. The US Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA) regulates both arsenic and uranium in US public drinking
   water systems, including community water systems (CWSs) which serve
   over 90% of residents year-round^[76]11. Although the US EPA sets a

   Racial and ethnic discrimination has a significant impact on the health
   of people of color, affecting mental health and contributing to high
   blood pressure, negative health behaviors, and early aging.^[44]1 For
   Black older adults, the cumulative effects of race-related stress
   experienced over the course of a life can increase the risk for mental
   and physical health problems.^[45]2

   In health care settings, experiences of discrimination can include
   providers dismissing a patient's symptoms or health concerns, offering
   different treatment based on a patient's type of insurance,^[46]3 or
   not providing care in a patient's preferred language.^[47]4

   We analyzed findings from the Commonwealth Fund 2021 International
   Health Policy Survey of Older Adults to examine experiences of racial
   discrimination in health care settings among Latinx/Hispanic and Black
   older adults. (See "[48]How We Conducted This Study" for more details.)
   To provide some cross-national context, we first detail the extent to
   which older adults in 11 high-income countries believe their national
   health system treats people unfairly because of race or ethnicity. We
   then look more in-depth at the United States and report on older
   Americans' experiences of discrimination and the consequences of health
   providers' unfair or dismissive treatment.^[49]5 Finally, we consider
   steps that U.S. health system leaders, health care educators,
   policymakers, and others can take to address discrimination and
   dismantle systemic racism in health care.

Highlights

     * Older adults in the United States are more likely to report racial
       and ethnic discrimination in the health system exists, compared
       with their peers in 10 other high-income countries.
     * In the U.S., one in four Black and Latinx/Hispanic adults age 60
       and older reported that they have been treated unfairly or have
       felt that their health concerns were not taken seriously by health
       professionals because of their racial or ethnic background.
     * More than a quarter of U.S. older adults said they did not get the
       care or treatment they felt they needed because of discrimination.
     * U.S. older adults who have experienced discrimination in a health
       care setting were more likely to have worse health status, face
       economic hardships, and be more dissatisfied with their care than
       those who did not experience discrimination.


Findings

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_01

   Looking across 11 high-income countries, one in three older adults in
   the U.S. said they believe their health system treats people
   differently because of their race or ethnicity, nearly double the rate
   of older adults in Canada (17%).

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_02

   In the United States, Black women and men are the most likely of any
   group to believe the health care system very often or often treats
   people differently because of their race or ethnicity. Across racial
   and ethnic groups, more women than men hold this view.

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_03

   When asked whether they have ever been treated unfairly or felt that
   their health concerns were not taken seriously because of their racial
   or ethnic background, one in four Black and Latinx/Hispanic older
   adults in the U.S. said they have experienced this type of
   discrimination, approximately eight times the rate for older white
   adults. There were not significant differences by gender between racial
   or ethnic groups.^[50]6

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_04

   More than a quarter (27%) of all U.S. older adults who experienced
   race- or ethnicity-based discrimination -- either their provider
   treated them unfairly or dismissed their health concerns because of
   their race or ethnicity -- said they did not receive the care they felt
   they needed.^[51]7 Previous research on older adults of color found
   that perceived discrimination was associated with an increased risk of
   avoiding or delaying care, in part because doctors may communicate
   messages that discourage appropriate use of health services.^[52]8

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_05

   The majority (61%) of U.S. older adults who said that they experienced
   discrimination based on their race or ethnicity were Black or Latinx
   (data not shown). Nearly half of those who experienced such
   discrimination reported being in fair or poor health, twice the rate of
   those who did not experience discrimination. In fact, three-quarters of
   adults who have felt discriminated against have three or more chronic
   conditions or need help with daily activities (data not shown). Older
   adults who have faced discrimination based on their race or ethnicity
   are also significantly more likely to feel socially isolated, have a
   mental health diagnosis, and experience a material hardship (always or
   usually feeling stressed about having enough money to pay for food,
   housing, or monthly bills).

   Older adults who have felt discriminated against when receiving care
   are significantly more likely to be dissatisfied with the quality of
   their care than those not reporting discrimination.^[53]9 More than
   four in 10 respondents who reported discrimination said they are
   somewhat or not at all satisfied, about double the rate for those who
   did not report discrimination.

   Consistent with previous research, older Black and Latinx/Hispanic
   adults are more likely than older white adults to report being in fair
   or poor health and to experience material hardships (data not shown).

Policy Recommendations

   Battling discrimination throughout the health care system is imperative
   to advancing health equity. Given that older adults use far more health
   care services than do younger people, and that the U.S. population is
   rapidly aging, addressing discrimination in health care settings is
   especially important for older adults of color. Ending discrimination
   and racism in health care begins with recognizing it and then actively
   working to dismantle it. Following are recommendations for spurring and
   supporting such efforts.

   Promote transparency and accountability by identifying instances of
   discrimination and publicly reporting discrimination data. One way is
   to provide patients with the opportunity to report experiences of
   racism or other types of discrimination when completing standard
   patient satisfaction surveys. Health care organizations could expand
   existing patient experience surveys to ask about discrimination, bring
   these reports to the attention of system leaders, and identify
   opportunities for improvement. To promote accountability, health care
   organizations also could be required to publicly report responses.

   Older adults of color, particularly those with health concerns, have
   many interactions with health personnel. Allowing them opportunities to
   reflect on how they were treated and to report their experiences with
   discrimination are important steps.

   Develop medical school curricula to educate students about how the U.S.
   health care system has harmed patients of color and other historically
   marginalized communities. Studies have shown that medical students'
   perceptions of race and implicit biases, together with false ideas of
   race-based biological differences, can affect their treatment
   recommendations for patients of color.^[54]10 The same is true for
   older patients: when medical students are exposed only to the sickest
   older patients in their training, they may adopt stereotypical thinking
   that affects treatment.^[55]11 To encourage their students to address
   bias, medical schools could teach the history of racism in the health
   system, institute implicit-bias training, and ensure that race is
   understood as a risk marker, not necessarily a risk factor, for health
   outcomes.^[56]12

   Examine how current policies enable discrimination and then remove or
   reform those policies. Understanding how federal, state, and health
   care organizations' policies and care delivery approaches enable
   discrimination and racism is an important step in diagnosing and
   treating racism in the health system at large.^[57]13 The National
   Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine is currently reviewing
   federal policies that promote health disparities, but private
   institutions could also systematically review their policies and
   practices to determine if and how they harm persons of color.^[58]14

   Address the lack of diversity in the U.S. health care workforce. A
   diverse health care workforce can help promote the cultural competency
   of providers and improve access to health care, since providers of
   color are more likely to work in underserved communities, including
   those with large elderly populations.^[59]15 Providers whose racial or
   ethnic background reflects that of their patients can also engender
   greater trust. To foster diversity, medical schools could show how they
   are seeking to improve diversity among faculty and students, evaluate
   the diversity and experiences of those on recruitment committees, and
   target community colleges, historically Black colleges and
   universities, and Hispanic-serving institutions in their
   recruitment.^[60]16

   Provide culturally and contextually appropriate care that addresses
   patients' communication needs and preferences. All patients should have
   the opportunity to receive care the reflects their cultural values and
   language needs. To provide such care, organizations can offer
   translation services and create medical forms in multiple languages and
   provide cultural competency training to staff.^[61]17 Organizations
   also could work with the communities they serve to ensure care delivery
   reflects the needs and preferences of the community.

   By taking these steps, health care organizations can do their part to
   address discrimination against older and younger adults alike to
   improve health equity and outcomes.

   HOW WE CONDUCTED THIS STUDY

   The Commonwealth Fund 2021 International Health Policy Survey of Older
   Adults was conducted from March 1 to June 14, 2021, by SSRS, a U.S.
   survey research firm, and contractors in the other countries. The
   survey was administered to a nationally representative sample of adults
   age 60 and older in the United States from March 11 to May 27, 2021.
   The survey was also administered to adults age 65 and older in
   Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
   Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

   The final U.S. sample was 1,969. Interviews were completed either
   online or using computer-assisted telephone interviews. Samples were
   generated using probability-based overlapping landline and mobile phone
   sampling designs. Both mobile and landline telephone numbers were
   included to improve representativeness. For landline samples, standard
   within-household selection procedures were used to increase the
   likelihood of reaching an eligible respondent.

   A common questionnaire was developed, translated, adapted, and adjusted
   for country-specific wording as needed. Interviewers were trained to
   conduct interviews using a standardized protocol. The U.S. response
   rate was 11.2 percent.

   International partners joined with the Commonwealth Fund to sponsor
   surveys, and some countries supported the use of expanded samples to
   enable within-country analyses. Data were weighted to ensure that the
   final outcome was representative of the adult population in each
   country. Weighting procedures considered the sample design, probability
   of selection, and systematic nonresponse across known population
   parameters including region, sex, age, education, and other demographic
   characteristics deemed consistent with standards for each country. In
   the United States, the weighted variables also included race and
   ethnicity.

   The margin of sample error for the 2021 International Health Policy
   Survey of Older Adults was approximately +/- 2 percent for the U.S., at
   the 95 percent confidence interval.

    5. Questions related to experiencing unfair or dismissive treatment
       and the consequences of discrimination were asked in the U.S. only.
       The U.S. sample included adults age 60 and older; respondents who
       self-identified as Asian American or another racial or ethnic group
       were not included in this study because of limited sample sizes.
    6. Black and Latinx/Hispanic adults make up most older adults (61%) in
       the U.S. who reported discrimination, yet these adults comprise
       only 19 percent of the survey population. Sample size of
       respondents who reported discrimination (N=149) is too small to
       stratify the analysis by race and ethnicity.

   In his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Boston
   on 27 July 2004, before 9 million viewers, [88]Barack Obama presented
   himself as the embodiment of racial reconciliation and American
   exceptionalism. He had humble beginnings and a lofty ascent, and in him
   both native and immigrant ancestry and African and European ancestry
   came together. "I stand here knowing that my story is part of the
   larger American story ... and that in no other country on Earth is my
   story even possible," he declared. "America, tonight, if you feel the
   same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you
   feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that
   I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across
   the country ... the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry
   will be sworn in as president."

   Kerry lost the election, of course, and Bush seemed poised to embody
   the future of the Republican party. But Barack Obama seemed poised to
   embody the future of the Democratic party.

   Two weeks after his exhilarating keynote address, Barack Obama's
   memoir, [89]Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance, was
   republished. It rushed up the charts and got rave reviews in the final
   months of 2004. Toni Morrison, the queen of American letters, deemed
   Dreams from My Father "quite extraordinary". Obama had written the
   memoir in 1995 as he prepared to begin his political career in the
   Illinois senate. In his most anti-racist passage, Obama reflected on
   assimilated biracial blacks like "poor Joyce," his friend at Occidental
   College in Los Angeles. In Joyce and other black students, he "kept
   recognising pieces of myself", Obama wrote. People like Joyce spoke
   about "the richness of their multicultural heritage, and it sounded
   real good, until you noticed that they avoided black people. It wasn't
   a matter of conscious choice, necessarily, just a matter of
   gravitational pull, the way integration always worked, a one-way
   street. The minority assimilated into the dominant culture, not the
   other way around. Only white culture could be `neutral' and
   `objective'. Only white culture could be `nonracial' ... Only white
   culture had `individuals'."

   Obama's anti-racist litany continued in his critical revelation of the
   "extraordinary negro" complex. "We, the half-breeds and the
   college-degreed ... [are] never so outraged as when a cabbie drives
   past us or the woman in the elevator clutches her purse, not so much
   because we're bothered by the fact that such indignities are what less
   fortunate coloureds have to put up with every single day of their lives
   - although that's what we tell ourselves - but because [we] ... have
   somehow been mistaken for an ordinary nigger. Don't you know who I am?
   I'm an individual!"

   Ironically, racist Americans of all colours would in 2004 begin hailing
   Barack Obama, with all his public intelligence, morality, speaking
   ability and political success, as the extraordinary negro. The
   extraordinary-negro hallmark had come a mighty long way from the poet
   Phillis Wheatley to Barack Obama, who became the nation's only African
   American in the US senate in 2005. Since Wheatley, segregationists had
   despised these extraordinary-negro exhibits of black capability and had
   done everything to take them down. But Obama - or rather Obama's era -
   was different. Segregationists turned their backs on their predecessors
   and adored the Obama exhibit as a proclamation of the end of racism.
   They wanted to end the discourse on discrimination.

   "He's the first mainstream African American who is articulate and
   bright and clean and a nice-looking guy." Presidential hopeful and
   Delaware senator Joe Biden might as well have labelled Barack Obama the
   extraordinary negro. Biden's evaluations of his presidential rivals
   appeared in the New York Observer days before Obama stood in front of
   the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois, and formally
   announced his presidential candidacy on 10 February 2007. Obama brimmed
   with words of American unity, hope and change.

   But Joe Biden's comments - which he later "deeply" regretted - became a
   sign of things to come. What was to come over the course of the
   campaign was a reflection of the audacity of racist minds - from George
   W Bush to radio mega-personality Rush Limbaugh to Democratic stalwarts
   - who all viewed Obama as an extraordinary negro. In February 2007,
   Time magazine speculated that African Americans were expressing greater
   support for New York senator [90]Hillary Clinton because of questions
   over whether Obama was "black enough". It couldn't be because they saw
   Obama as a long shot. It had to be that they did not see Obama as
   ordinarily black like them, meaning inarticulate and ugly and unclean
   and unintelligent.

   Pundits were dubbing Hillary Clinton the "inevitable" nominee until
   Barack Obama upset her on 3 January 2008, in the Iowa primary. By Super
   Tuesday on 5 February 2008, Americans had been swept up in the Obama
   "Yes We Can" crusade of hope and change - themes he embodied and spoke
   about so eloquently in his stump speeches that people started to
   hunger. In mid-February, his perceptive and brilliant wife, Michelle
   Obama, told a Milwaukee rally: "For the first time in my adult life, I
   am really proud of my country, and not just because Barack has done
   well, but because I think people are hungry for change."

   Racist commentators searched for dirt on the Obamas. When no dirt could
   be found, investigative reporters started checking their associates. In
   early March 2008, ABC News released snippets of sermons from one of
   black America's most revered liberation theologians, the recently
   retired pastor of Chicago's large Trinity United Church of Christ.
   Jeremiah Wright had married the Obamas and had baptised their two
   daughters. In an ABC News report, Wright was quoted proclaiming, in a
   sermon, that "the government gives them the drugs, builds bigger
   prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing `God Bless
   America'. No, no, no ... God damn America for treating our citizens as
   less than human." Wright had discarded the very old racist lesson that
   had first been taught to slaves: that African Americans were supposed
   to love the US and consider it the world's greatest country, no matter
   how they were treated. On top of his rejection of American
   exceptionalism, Wright had the audacity to preach that American
   "terrorism" abroad had helped bring on the tragic events of 9/11. To
   put it lightly, Americans everywhere were livid.

   When Obama's flippant characterisations of Wright as a fraught "old
   uncle" did not calm Americans down, Obama decided to address the
   controversy. On 18 March 2008, he stepped into the spotlight and gave a
   "race speech," entitled A More Perfect Union, at Philadelphia's
   National Constitutional Center. Having taught constitutional law,
   worked in civil rights law, and overseen successful political campaigns
   (including his current campaign, which analysts were already regarding
   as masterful), Obama could easily be regarded as an expert on many
   things: constitutional law, civil rights law, Chicago politics,
   Illinois politics, campaigning, and race and politics.

   Obama dismissed Jeremiah Wright's "profoundly distorted view", but
   courageously refused to totally disown Wright. And then he opened his
   general lecture on race, explaining that socioeconomic racial
   inequities stemmed from the history of discrimination. From this firm
   anti-racist opening, he pivoted to the consensus racist theory of the
   "pervasive achievement gap", to the disproven racist theory of "the
   erosion of black families" that "welfare policies ... may have
   worsened", and to the unproven racist theory that racialdiscrimination
   had bequeathed blacks a "legacy of defeat". According to Obama, this
   "legacy of defeat" explained why "young men and, increasingly, young
   women" were "standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons".
   He ignored the fact that this population was facing some of the
   nation's highest unemployment and policing rates.

   Those anti-racists like Jeremiah Wright, their "anger is not always
   productive", Obama continued. "Indeed, all too often it distracts
   attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing
   our own complicity within the African American community in our
   condition."

   It was a classic assimilationist retort: calling anti-racists "angry"
   for truly believing in racial equality, for not seeing anything wrong
   with black people, and for seeing everything wrong with discrimination.
   Like civil rights activists [91]WEB Du Bois and [92]Martin Luther King
   before him, Obama lumped these "angry" anti-racists in with angry,
   anti-white cynics to discredit them and distinguish himself from them.
   But Du Bois and King ultimately had to ward off the same "angry" and
   anti-white labels they had helped to produce. And now, Obama was doing
   the same thing, unaware that he was reproducing a label that his
   opponents would stamp on to him whenever and wherever he uttered
   another anti-racist word after this speech.

   Barack Obama's 2008 speech at the National Constitution Center in
   Philadelphia

   Obama encouraged African Americans to fight discrimination, take
   personal responsibility, be better parents and end the "legacy of
   defeat". Obama did not offer any childrearing or psychological lessons
   for the presumably parentally and psychologically superior white
   Americans. He merely asked them to join him on the "long march" against
   racialdiscrimination - "not just with words but with deeds". He left
   the Philadelphia platform on 18 March 2008, as he began, expressing the
   half-truthful analogy of continuous racial progression. "This union may
   never be perfect," he said, "but generation after generation has shown
   that it can always be perfected."

   Segregationist and anti-racist critiques were drowned out by the
   eruption of praise across the ideological aisle. MSNBC political
   analyst Michelle Bernard framed it as "the best speech and most
   important speech on race that we have heard as a nation since Martin
   Luther King's `I Have a Dream' speech". And it was not just Democrats
   who were fawning. Prominent Republicans - everyone from presidential
   candidates Mike Huckabee and John McCain to the Bush administration's
   Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell, and the Clintons' old foe, Newt
   Gingrich - were also praising the speech.

   Meanwhile, Republican producers of racist ideas got down to business,
   demanding to see [94]Obama's birth certificate, questioning whether
   Barack Hussein Obama was really an American, and suggesting that only
   real Americans, who were white like McCain, could live in the White
   House of the United States. The Obama campaign released [95]a scanned
   copy of his US birth certificate, but the rumours of Obama being born
   in Kenya or some Islamic anti-American nation did not suddenly go away.
   They were not started out of ignorance, so why would they go away out
   of knowledge?
     __________________________________________________________________

   On 4 November 2008, a 64-year-old recently retired professor cast a
   vote for a major political party for the first time in her voting life.
   She had retired from academia, but not from her very public activism of
   four decades. She was still travelling the country trying to rouse an
   abolitionist movement against prisons. In casting her vote for Democrat
   Barack Obama, [96]Angela Davis joined roughly 69.5 million Americans.
   But more than voting for the man, Davis voted for the grassroots
   efforts of the campaign organisers, those millions of people demanding
   change.

   When the networks started announcing that Obama had been elected the
   44th president of the United States, happiness exploded from coast to
   coast, and from the US around the anti-racist world. Davis was in the
   delirium of Oakland, California. People she did not know came up and
   hugged her as she walked along the streets. She saw people singing and
   dancing. And the people [97]Angela Davis saw and all the others around
   the world who were celebrating were not enraptured from the election of
   an individual; they were enraptured by the pride of the victory for
   black people, by the success of millions of grassroots organisers, and
   because they had shown all those disbelievers, who had said that
   electing a black president was impossible, to be wrong. Most of all,
   they were enraptured by the anti-racist potential of a black president.

   Behind the scenes of exploding happiness that November night and over
   the next few weeks, was the exploding fury of hate attacks on black
   people. The establishment was working overtime to take down some of the
   colour-blind rhetoric that had prevented consumers from seeing
   discrimination for a decade. It was working to put up something better:
   a portrait of America conveying that there was no longer any need for
   protective or affirmative civil rights laws and policies - and no
   longer any need to ever talk about race. "Are we now in a post-racial
   America? ... Is America past racism against black people?" John
   McWhorter, professor at Columbia, asked in Forbes weeks after the
   election. "I say the answer is yes."
     __________________________________________________________________

   When will the day arrive when black lives matter to Americans? It
   depends largely on what anti-racists do - and on the strategies they
   use to stamp out racist ideas. Racial reformers have customarily
   requested or demanded that Americans, particularly white Americans,
   sacrifice their own privileges for the betterment of black people. And
   yet, this strategy is based on one of the oldest myths of the modern
   era, a myth continuously produced and reproduced by racists and
   anti-racists alike: that racism materially benefits the majority of
   white people, that white people would lose and not gain in the
   reconstruction of an anti-racist America.

   It has been true that racist policies have benefited white people in
   general at the expense of black people (and others) in general. That is
   the story of racism, of unequal opportunity in a nutshell. But it is
   also true that a society of equal opportunity, without a top 1%
   hoarding the wealth and power, would actually benefit the vast majority
   of white people much more than racism does.

   Anti-racists should stop connecting selfishness to racism, and
   unselfishness to anti-racism. Altruism is wanted, not required.
   Anti-racists do not have to be altruistic. Anti-racists do not have to
   be selfless. Anti-racists merely have to have intelligent
   self-interest, and to stop consuming those racist ideas that have
   engendered so much unintelligent self-interest over the years. It is in
   the intelligent self-interest of middle- and upper-income blacks to
   challenge the racism affecting the black poor, knowing they will not be
   free of the racism that is slowing their socio-economic rise until poor
   blacks are free of racism.

   It is in the intelligent self-interest of white Americans to challenge
   racism, knowing they will not be free of sexism, class bias, homophobia
   and ethnocentrism until black people are free of racism. The histories
   of anti-Asian, anti-Native and anti-Latina/o racist ideas; the
   histories of sexist, elitist, homophobic, and ethnocentric ideas: all
   sound eerily similar to this history of racist ideas, and feature some
   of the same defenders of bigotry in America. Supporting these
   prevailing bigotries is only in the intelligent self-interest of a tiny
   group of super-rich, Protestant, heterosexual, non-immigrant, white,
   Anglo-Saxon males. Those are the only people who need to be altruistic
   in order to be anti-racist. The rest of us merely need to do the
   intelligent thing for ourselves.

   Historically, black people have by and large worked out that the
   smartest thing we could do for ourselves is to promote the notion of
   uplift. Beginning around the 1790s, abolitionists urged the growing
   number of free blacks to exhibit upstanding behaviour in front of white
   people, believing they would thereby undermine the racist beliefs
   behind slavery. Black people would acquire "the esteem, confidence and
   patronage of the whites, in proportion to your increase in knowledge
   and moral improvement," as the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison
   lectured free blacks in the 1830s.

   History shows not only that uplift has failed, but that, generally
   speaking, the opposite of its intended effect has occurred. Racist
   Americans have routinely despised those black Americans the most who
   uplifted themselves, who defied those racist laws and theories that
   individuals employed to keep them down. So upwardly mobile black people
   have not persuaded away racist ideas or policies. Quite the contrary.
   Uplift has brought on the progression of new racist policies and ideas
   after blacks broke through the old ones.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Everyone who has witnessed the historic presidency of Barack Obama -
   and the historic opposition to him - should now know full well that the
   more black people uplift themselves, the more they will find themselves
   on the receiving end of a racist backlash. Uplift, as a strategy for
   racial progress, has failed. Black individuals must stop worrying about
   what other people may think about them. Individual blacks are not race
   representatives. They are not responsible for those Americans who hold
   racist ideas. Black people need to be their imperfect selves around
   white people, around each other, around all people. Black is beautiful
   and ugly, intelligent and unintelligent, law-abiding and law-breaking,
   industrious and lazy - and it is those imperfections that make black
   people human, make black people equal to all other imperfectly human
   groups.

   The other major strategy that racial reformers have used is educational
   persuasion. As a strategy for racial progress, educational persuasion
   has failed, because it has been predicated on the false construction of
   the race problem: the idea that ignorance and hate lead to racist
   ideas, which lead to racist policies. In fact, self-interest leads to
   racist policies, which lead to racist ideas, leading to all the
   ignorance and hate.

   Racist policies were created out of self-interest. And so, they have
   usually been voluntarily rolled back out of self-interest. The popular
   and glorious version of history saying that abolitionists and civil
   rights activists have steadily educated and persuaded away American
   racist ideas and policies sounds great. But it has never been the
   complete story, or even the main story. Politicians passed the civil
   and voting rights measures in the 1860s and the 1960s primarily out of
   political and economic self-interest - not an educational or moral
   awakening. And these laws did not spell the doom of racist policies.
   The racist policies simply evolved. There has been a not-so-glorious
   progression of racism, and educational persuasion has failed to stop
   it, and Americans have failed to recognise it.

   History is clear. Sacrifice, uplift, persuasion and education have not
   eradicated, are not eradicating, and will not eradicate racist ideas,
   let alone racist policies. Power will never sacrifice self-interest,
   cannot be educated away from its self-interest. Those who have the
   power to abolish racialdiscrimination have not done so thus far, and
   they will never do so as long as racism benefits them in some way.

   I am certainly not stating that there are no Americans in positions of
   power who have ever tried to end racial disparities in their sphere of
   influence. But these courageous anti-racist powerbrokers are more the
   exception than the rule. As Americans have discarded old racist ideas,
   new racist ideas have constantly been produced for their consumption.
   That's why the effort to educate and persuade away racist ideas has
   been a never-ending affair in America. That's why education will never
   bring into being an anti-racist America.

   To undermine racialdiscrimination, Americans must focus their efforts
   on those who have the power to undermine racialdiscrimination. History
   has shown that those Americans who have had the power to undermine
   racialdiscrimination have rarely done so. They have done so, however,
   when they realised that eliminating some form of racialdiscrimination
   was in their interest, much as Abraham Lincoln chose to end slavery to
   save the union. They have also conceded to anti-racist change as a
   better alternative than the disruptive, disordered, politically harmful
   and/or unprofitable conditions that anti-racist protesters created.

   The most effective protests have been fiercely local; they are protests
   started by anti-racists focusing on their immediate surroundings: their
   blocks, neighbourhoods, schools, colleges, jobs and professions. These
   local protests have then become statewide protests, and statewide
   protests have then become national protests, and national protests have
   then become international protests. But it all starts with one person,
   or two people, or tiny groups, in their small surroundings, engaging in
   energetic mobilisation of anti-racists into organisations; and
   chess-like planning and adjustments during strikes, occupations,
   insurrections, campaigns and fiscal and bodily boycotts, among a series
   of other tactics to force power to eradicate racist policies.
   Anti-racist protesters have created positions of power for themselves
   by articulating clear demands and making it even clearer that they will
   not stop - and that policing forces cannot stop them - until their
   demands are met.

   But protesting against racist policies can never be a long-term
   solution to eradicating racialdiscrimination in America. Just as one
   generation of powerful Americans could decide or be pressured by
   protest to end racialdiscrimination, when the conditions and interests
   change, another generation could once again encourage racial
   discrimination. That's why protesting against racist power has been a
   never-ending affair in America.

   Protesting against racist power and succeeding can never be mistaken
   for seizing power. Any effective solution to eradicating American
   racism must involve Americans committed to anti-racist policies seizing
   and maintaining power over institutions, neighbourhoods, counties,
   states, nations - the world. It makes no sense to sit back and put the
   future in the hands of people committed to racist policies, or people
   who sail with the wind of self-interest. An anti-racist America can
   only be guaranteed if principled anti-racists are in power, and then
   anti-racist policies become the law of the land, and then anti-racist
   ideas become the common sense of the people, and then the anti-racist
   common sense of the people holds those anti-racist leaders and policies
   accountable.

   And that day is sure to come. No power lasts for ever. There will come
   a time when Americans will realise that the only thing wrong with black
   people is that they think something is wrong with black people. There
   will come a time when racist ideas will no longer obstruct us from
   seeing the complete and utter abnormality of racial disparities.

   There will come a time when we will love humanity, when we will gain
   the courage to fight for an equitable society for our beloved humanity,
   knowing, intelligently, that when we fight for humanity, we are
   fighting for ourselves. There will come a time. Maybe, just maybe, that
   time is now.

Racial and Class Discrimination in the History of the American South

   Topic: History Words: 1387 Pages: 5 Dec 16th, 2022

Introduction

   The American South became famous in world historiography due to extreme
   forms of slavery and discrimination from the white planter class. The
   peculiar way of life and plantation culture of the American South
   developed during the British colonization of North America and evolved
   after the country gained independence. The South of the USA includes,
   for the most part, the states that in 1861-1865 made up the Confederate
   States of America and opposed the North during the American Civil War.

   The climate of the South made it possible to grow plantation crops.
   Before 1800, slave labor benefited tobacco, rice, sugarcane, indigo,
   and hemp growers^1. Agriculture demanded year-round work, which, with a
   shortage of labor from the 17th century, led to the use of the labor of
   Negro slaves. In this regard, in the southern English colonies in North
   America, plantation slavery, features of an aristocratic culture
   appeared, close to the landowning nobility in Europe. The North-South
   Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement are two events in the history
   of the American South caused by racial and class discrimination.

The Civil War

The Roles of Race and Class

   The key differences between the industrialized North and the agrarian
   South of the United States were further intensified in the early 19th
   century. The Industrial Revolution began in the North, and in the
   South, the invention of the cotton gin made cotton the main crop. The
   North quickly overtook the South in terms of population: by 1860,
   Southerners made up only a third of the US population. Focusing on the
   foreign market, the South, to maintain its slave system, took the
   extreme step of separating from the United States: in 1861, the
   Confederate States of America was proclaimed. This event sparked a
   civil war in which the South was defeated. After that, the so-called
   Reconstruction of the South was carried out, which lasted until 1877. A
   military administration was introduced in the southern states; most of
   the southern states were occupied for a long time, having almost no
   political rights.

   The American Civil War, also called the War of the North and the South,
   went down in history as the largest conflict on the American continent.
   The consensus of modern historians is that slavery was the chief cause
   of the Civil War^2. Free emigrants replenished the population of the
   northern states and the southern states by slaves imported from abroad.
   By the early 1860s, only a quarter of the population of the southern
   states had the right to vote. Southerners feared that with such
   dynamics, all controversial political issues in Congress would be
   decided in favor of the North because they had the majority of voice.

   All agriculture in the South was based on free slave labor, and
   unskilled factory slaves were inefficient. The industrialists of the
   North needed slavery to get free workers, so they advocated the
   abolition of slavery. In addition, for southern planters, this would
   mean the collapse of the entire economic system built. Besides, the
   moral side of the issue was also important: many public figures in
   America criticized slavery as an inhuman relic of the past and demanded
   its abolition.

Other Reasons

   In addition, the central government, located in the North, sought to
   extend influence to all states, while the Southern Territories wanted
   to maintain local self-government. The country's entire industry was
   concentrated in the North, while cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, and other
   industrial crops were collected in the South. The Southern states
   supplied raw materials to the North for a long time, where local
   producers processed it and exported goods. However, at some point, the
   planters realized that it was much more profitable to trade with Europe
   without intermediaries. The manufacturers of the North were at risk of
   running out of supplies, and European ones were supplanting their goods
   in the South. Wanting to protect the domestic market, the government
   imposed huge taxes on trade with Europe, which caused discontent among
   the southerners.

The Civil Rights Movement

The Roles of Race and Class

   The Civil Rights Movement became a grassroots movement of black
   American citizens and white activists who supported them against racial
   discrimination in the 1950s and 1960s. In the southern states,
   centuries of slavery and decades of segregation have created a legal
   and political system characterized by white supremacy. There were laws
   according to which Afro-Americans could not study at schools and
   universities along with whites and had their system of schools and
   universities; they had to occupy specially designated places for them
   in public transport. Many shops, restaurants, hotels refused to serve
   blacks. The whites counted on their obedience; the resistance of the
   Afro-Americans seemed unthinkable. Many white southerners were
   convinced that Afro-Americans had taken on the role of second-class
   citizens, and they even liked it.

   The African American legal strategy culminated in the US Supreme Court
   in 1954, under the leadership of Earl Warren, which overturned many
   laws that allowed for racial segregation and discrimination. The
   movement began when the US Supreme Court concedes that segregation is
   wrong. ^3African Americans were re-entering politics in the South, and
   young people across the country were inspired to take action. From 1964
   to 1970, a wave of urban riots and protests in black communities
   weakened support from the white middle class, but support from private
   foundations increased. The emergence of the Black Power movement
   challenged the established black leadership for its cooperation and
   continued legalism and non-violence. Many popular ideas about the
   movement are linked to the racially discriminatory movement of Martin
   Luther King Jr., who was fighting racial inequality through nonviolent
   resistance.

Other Reasons

   Two main causes drove the civil rights movement; discrimination and
   segregation of African Americans. Another reason for the rise of the
   movement can be called the economic superiority of the white population
   over the blacks. The starting point was the stereotypes entrenched in
   society that made strong racialdiscrimination possible. People's
   discontent grew, given that a significant part of the population did
   not even have the right to vote, children could not study on an equal
   basis with others, discrimination even touched places on buses.

One Race or Class Has Been More Powerful than the Other

   Historically, the white race has always had economic and social
   superiority over the black race. However, racial and class superiority
   did not stop African Americans from fighting for their rights and
   making a difference. On the side of the oppressed population was the
   moral right to be considered equal to the other part of the population.
   This realization of the rightness of one's actions led, for example, to
   the success of the Civil Rights Movement. Although the Civil War ended
   in defeat for the South, it set in motion a chain of societal changes
   that led African Americans to improve their position later on.

The Most Powerful in Driving the History of the American South

   The history of the American South was largely influenced by slavery.
   Oppression, cruelty, and discrimination led to a fierce struggle for
   the black population for their rights^4. Slavery radically influenced
   American South history and the development of the entire country. Four
   hundred years ago, the British brought the first African slaves to
   Virginia. This event marked the beginning of the British and American
   transatlantic slave trade. From 1619 to 1860, about 600 thousand
   African slaves were forcibly imported into the United States. By the
   middle of the 19th century, the number of black slaves in the United
   States had reached about 4 million people. Their exploitation played an
   important role in the development of American capitalism. Slavery in
   the United States was prohibited only in 1865, but for another 100
   years, segregation restrictions were in effect in the country:
   segregation restrictions were lifted only in the 1960s. The
   socio-economic consequences of the slave system in America are still
   being felt.

Conclusion

   Racial and class discrimination can be called the main driving force in
   the history of the American South. Discrimination was the main cause of
   the events described: the American Civil War and the Civil Rights
   Movement. There were other reasons, mostly behind the key differences
   between the industrial North and the agrarian South. Slavery can, in
   principle, be called the cause that influenced the course of the
   development of the United States as a whole. Even in modern society,
   echoes of this terrible oppression are heard.

Paul F. deLespinasse: Are we combating discrimination the wrong way?
     __________________________________________________________________

   Paul F. deLespinasse  |  The Daily Telegram

   racialdiscrimination is a major problem. But the approach we have
   taken to fix this problem is itself problematical.

   Slavery and segregation were created by legislation enforced by
   rigorous government sanctions. Legal reforms were obviously needed, and
   the first step was to eliminate this legislation.

   In his 1963 "Letter From A Birmingham Jail," Martin Luther King
   proclaimed that "An unjust law is a code that a majority inflicts on a
   minority that is not binding on itself. This is difference made
   legal."

   King was right, because genuine laws must be general rules of action,
   and rules applying only to people of one race are not general. A
   general rule must apply to anybody taking the prohibited action.

   A rule requiring only people of color to ride in the back of the bus is
   clearly not a general one. (And it would make no sense at all to
   require everybody to ride in the back of the bus. No matter to whom it
   is applied, this kind of rule is just plain crazy!)

   I differ from Dr. King only in that I don't concede that the unjust
   codes he referred to rise to the dignity of law at all. They are
   pseudolaws, not just bad laws.

   The pseudolaws supporting slavery and mandating racial segregation have
   been repealed or declared unconstitutional. But lingering social
   attitudes, institutional inertia and continued suffering of descendants
   of the former slaves called for further major reforms.

   Laws whose goal was to reduce or eliminate racialdiscrimination were
   an obvious and legitimate next step.

   A genuine civil rights law whose goal is to combat racial
   discrimination could have been a requirement that stores and other
   public facilities accept all would be customers first come, first
   served.

   The vital parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dealing with open
   accommodations (in stores, restaurants, hotels, etc.) would have been
   even more effective if they had been, instead, first come, first served
   rules.

   But rather than imposing a first come, first served rule, civil rights
   legislation has tried to make make "discrimination" itself illegal. The
   problem is that discrimination is not an action. It can be a reason or
   motivation for an action, but it is not itself an action. And as I
   indicated already, law must be a rule of action.

   Under current legislation, the act of declining to hire a person of
   color is not illegal unless the reason for that decision is that the
   applicant is a person of color.

   The very same action in identical circumstances can thus be either
   legal or legal, depending on whether a judge, jury or bureaucrat thinks
   that the motive for the action was illegal. Since motives cannot be
   observed but must be inferred, or assumed, this gives officials
   tremendous discretionary power.

   By contrast, although the motive for violating a first come, first
   served rule would be legally irrelevant, such laws would prevent
   establishments from engaging in racialdiscrimination. Since
   discrimination is not an action, efforts to make it illegal are
   pseudolaws.

   Paradoxically, our efforts to eliminate racialdiscrimination have
   employed the same kind of illegitimate tools that created slavery and
   racial segregation.

   Formerly, individuals and organizations wishing to enter into voluntary
   associations with people of another race were "legally" prevented from
   doing so. This is what segregation did.

   We now try to force people of different races to enter into
   associations with each other whether they prefer to do so or not. These
   associations are hardly voluntary ones, since voluntary associations
   can only be created by mutual consent to associate.

   We should try a third approach: respecting freedom of voluntary
   association except when limits on this freedom are imposed by genuine
   laws.

   racialdiscrimination In The USA

   The USA has had a very bad history when it comes to racial
   discrimination. The country in 18th century brought lot of slave
   workers and they all were from Africa and Asia. These people did not
   have any rights. The culture of racialdiscrimination continued for
   such a long time that it became embedded in the people's minds. Now its
   very natural for the people to see other races as unworthy and down.
   Many Indians have also faced a lot of problems in the past due to the
   racial abuse. The people do not get promotions in their jobs and they
   do not get equal salary as their white counterparts. Some are even
   subjected to violence. Lot of Indian Sikhs have been murdered and at
   the receiving end of physical abuse in the USA.

   On top of that Barack Obama said that religious tolerance in India has
   been going down!

   Formal racialdiscrimination was largely banned in the mid-20th
   century, and ... In the view of the U.S. Human Rights Network, a
   network of scores of US civil ...

   Dec 7, 2014 ... Addressing protests over minorities killed by police

Ask the Expert: What is critical race theory and why is it under attack in
our schools?

   "Ask the Expert" articles provide information and insights from MSU
   scientists, researchers and scholars about national and global issues,
   complex research and general-interest subjects based on their areas of
   academic expertise and study. They may feature historical information,
   background, research findings, or offer tips.

   Michigan joins other states that have introduced legislation that would
   sharply limit classroom discussions on how race and racism have shaped
   American history.


   [36]Dorinda Carter Andrews, professor and chairperson, [37]Department
   of Teacher Education at Michigan State University's [38]College of
   Education, said this is an ill-formed conflation, and answers other
   questions about critical race theory.


   Dorinda Carter Andrews, professor and chairperson, Department of
   Teacher Education at Michigan State University's College of Education.


   What is critical race theory?


   Critical race theory, or CRT, is a framework developed in the 1970s by
   legal scholars that argues white supremacy maintains power through the
   law and other legal systems. CRT dismisses the idea that racism stems
   from acts of individuals but rather rooted in a system of oppression
   based on socially constructed racial hierarchy where white people reap
   material benefits over people of color resulting from misuse of
   power.


   Teaching young people about race and racism is not synonymous with
   teaching them critical race theory. Critical race theory is not an
   ideology or a political orientation that assumes white people are bad;
   it assumes white supremacy is bad in all of its forms. It's a practice
   or approach that provides language and a lens for examining racism at
   institutional and structural levels. Underlying this is the premise
   that racism is endemic to American society and that white supremacist
   ideals and practices should be dismantled.



   Why are there proposals to ban critical race theory in schools?


   As of mid-May, legislation to outlaw CRT in schools [39]has passed in
   Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma and Tennessee and have been proposed in various
   other statehouses. Since the onset of teaching about American history,
   teachers have been teaching about forms of systemic racial
   discrimination and oppression, including slavery. This is not new to
   schools. However, traditionally school curriculums have taken a
   Eurocentric approach.


   Now we are living in a time where the voices of people of color are
   being lifted up, and tragic events like George Floyd's death one year
   ago and violence against members of the Asian panethnic community prove
   that problems remain. The narrative of U.S. history is being
   diversified, and that is creating fear, particularly among white
   people. Teaching young people how to be antiracist should not be seen
   as an attack on American values. It's actually working in support of
   American ideals like inclusion and valuing diverse perspectives.



   Why is it important for students to learn about systemic racism in
   schools?


   It's important to try to help youth understand how bias and oppression
   are institutional, structural and systemic, and not simply
   interpersonal. Young people are not colorblind or color mute. They see
   color and they talk race and racism in their own social circles and
   peer groups. Research indicates that as early as age 3, children have
   negative associations about some racial groups. By the time they enter
   elementary school, children already have a level of racial literacy
   that evidences their awareness that some individuals and groups are
   treated differently in their schools and society based on skin color.
   This is particularly apparent for elementary-aged children of color. If
   children of color are old enough to experience racialdiscrimination
   and injustice, then all children, especially white children, are old
   enough to learn about racism in ways that enhance their cross-cultural
   competency, racial literacy skills and skill set for improving our
   democracy.



   What is proposed in the Michigan legislation?


   A new bill introduced to the Michigan Legislature would sharply limit
   Michigan classroom discussions of how race and racism have shaped
   American history. Under the legislation introduced, K-12 school
   districts would lose 5% of their funding if educators teach critical
   race theory, "anti-American" ideas about race in America, or material
   from The 1619 Project, a New York Times initiative that puts Black
   history and the consequences of slavery at the center of the U.S.
   national narrative. School funding penalties tied to implementing
   antiracist curriculum is actually a racist move that furthers systemic
   racial oppression in education, disadvantages all children, and upholds
   white supremacist ideals.



   What are the possible consequences of this legislation?


   The bills are vague and it's unclear what they will cover and if they
   are constitutional, or whether they impermissibly restrict free speech.


   It would be difficult to monitor what goes on inside hundreds of
   thousands of classrooms. Educators fear that such laws could have a
   sobering effect on teachers who might censor lessons out of concern for
   parent or administrator complaints. Additionally, such bills can
   actually work to undermine educational goals of diversifying the
   teaching workforce. Students of color may be less likely to pursue a
   teaching career if there is censorship around race talk across subject
   areas.

DOJ touts first-of-its-kind settlement in racialdiscrimination case
targeting 'crime-free housing' policy

   The US Justice Department on Wednesday filed what it is describing as a
   first-of-its-kind settlement in a racialdiscrimination case
   challenging a so-called "crime-free housing ordinance."

   CNN -- The US Justice Department on Wednesday filed what it is
   describing as a first-of-its-kind settlement in a racialdiscrimination
   case challenging a so-called "crime-free housing ordinance."

   The proposed consent decree was filed Wednesday in a lawsuit the
   Justice Department brought in 2019 against the central California city
   of Hesperia, alleging that the city's ordinance violated the Fair
   Housing Act's prohibitions on racialdiscrimination in housing access.

   Hesperia continues to deny the allegations.

   According to DOJ's court filings, the 2015 ordinance instructed
   landlords to evict tenants accused of criminal conduct, even if those
   allegations have not resulted in an arrest or a conviction.

   "As our complaint makes clear, Hesperia's ordinance was a blatantly
   racially discriminatory solution to a problem that didn't exist,"
   Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clark, who leads the DOJ Civil
   Rights division, said on a press call Wednesday.

   She noted under the program, Black renters were almost four times more
   likely to be evicted than White renters and Latino renters were 29%
   more likely to be evicted.

   She said that some 2,000 jurisdictions across 48 states have enacted
   similar policies and that the new settlement sent a signal to other
   communities that they'd be held accountable if their housing policies
   violated anti-discrimination law.

   "This landmark agreement is historic," Clark said. "It marks the
   Justice Department's first settlement in a case challenge a crime-free
   ordinance and results in the full repeal of the program and nearly $1
   million in monetary commitment."

   Last month, the city repealed the ordinance, which was previously
   amended in 2017 to make the program voluntary. According to the Justice
   Department, Hesperia and its co-defendants -- the county of San
   Bernardino and the San Bernardino Sheriffs Department -- have agreed to
   pay a $950,000 settlement.

   It will compensate people who were harmed under the policy and will
   cover anti-discrimination training and other initiatives.

   A lawyer for Hesperia said that the city's move to resolve the case
   "was based solely on a sound financial decision on behalf of the
   citizens of the City."

   "At no time has the City admitted liability in this matter, and the
   City continues to vehemently deny all allegations contained within the
   complaint filed by the Department of Justice," the lawyer, J. Pat
   Ferraris told CNN in an email.

The Latest Threat to the Voting Rights Act: Merrill v. Milligan

   Blog / Last Updated: December 8, 2022

   Share this:

   This blog was written by legal intern Gabby Means.

   In the last decade, the US Supreme Court has severely weakened the
   Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), which was widely agreed to be [34]the
   most effective civil rights law in our history.

   Beginning with its 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which
   [35]gutted the VRA by [36]rendering Section 5 ineffective, the Court
   has chipped away at the power of the VRA. Most recently, the Court
   weakened Section 2 of the VRA, one of the last protections against
   racially discriminatory voting laws. It did so in the 2021 decision in
   Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, where the Court [37]made it
   more difficult for voting rights plaintiffs to challenge racially
   discriminatory voting laws in court.

   This term, the Court considers Section 2 again in [38]Merrill v.
   Milligan. This time, the Court threatens to weaken well-established
   precedent lower courts have used for decades to evaluate redistricting
   plans alleged to be racially discriminatory. In this blog, we will
   explore the history of Section 2 and its impact on discriminatory
   redistricting plans, explain the dispute at issue in Milligan, and
   preview potential next steps to protect voting rights.

Background on the Voting Rights Act

   The VRA was passed in response to deliberate efforts to prevent Black
   Americans from voting, including violence and terror. States --
   particularly in the South -- were thwarting their pro-equality,
   anti-discrimination obligations under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
   Amendments, and Congress determined further protections were
   required.

   The VRA created remarkable remedies and protections to ensure that no
   one is prevented from participating in the political process because of
   their race. Its core protections are in Section 5 and Section 2 of the
   Act. Section 5 established a system of "federal preclearance," which
   required jurisdictions with a history of racialdiscrimination in
   voting to seek preapproval before making any changes to their voting
   practices. For voters harmed by jurisdictions with racially
   discriminatory voting policies and practices, Section 2 provided them
   with legal recourse.

   The Voting Rights Act was reauthorized -- with strong bipartisan
   support -- multiple times, most recently in 2006. But in 2013, the US
   Supreme Court held that the Section 5 coverage formula for determining
   which jurisdictions must submit to federal preclearance was not
   justified by current conditions. The decision essentially nullified
   Section 5 until a new coverage formula is passed in Congress (which has
   yet to occur). As the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in her
   dissent, "throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is
   continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away
   your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."
   Unsurprisingly, since this decision, several restrictive state voting
   rights laws have been enacted.

   Section 2 of the VRA has always been critical to protect voters, but
   without a functioning Section 5, Section 2 is even more necessary to
   challenge policies and practices that intend to or effect of harming
   voters of color. As explored below, Merrill v. Milligan threatens
   Section 2 and voters' ability to use it to challenge racial
   discrimination in voting.

Claims Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act: Vote Denial &amp; Vote Dilution

   Under Section 2(a) of the VRA, states may not pass any law that
   "results in a denial or abridgment" of the right to vote "on account of
   race or color." Put simply, Section 2 prohibits any standard, practice,
   or procedure imposed or applied to deny or limit the right to vote
   based on race or color.

   Cases brought under Section 2 [40]have historically involved two types
   of violations:

   1) Vote dilution; and

   2) Vote denial.

Vote Denial

   Vote denial claims typically challenge practices that render voting
   "not equally open to participation" for voters protected by Section 2
   -- racial and language minority groups. They became more common as
   states rushed to pass restrictive voting laws after the Shelby County
   decision. A common vote denial claim post-Shelby County are challenges
   to restrictive photo ID laws that disproportionately prevent voters of
   color from voting.

   Until the ruling in Brnovich, the Supreme Court had not squarely
   addressed Section 2 vote denial claims. [41]As noted in our previous
   blog, the Court in Brnovich dealt a blow to voters' ability to
   challenge racialdiscrimination in voting under Section 2.

Vote Dilution

   [42]The most common and well-established use of Section 2 -- and the
   claim raised in Milligan v. Merrill -- is a vote dilution claim, raised
   [43]in the context of redistricting and changes to jurisdiction
   boundaries. A violation of Section 2 occurs when states draw districts
   in a way that gives voters of color less power "to elect
   representatives of their choice."

   The earliest vote dilution cases concerned at-large voting; an election
   scheme used to drown out the power of voters of color. More recently,
   vote dilution claims have been brought to challenge redistricting plans
   that dilute the political power of Black residents and other
   communities of color on the local, state, and federal levels.

   The Supreme Court has decided several vote dilution cases since the VRA
   was passed in 1965, including Thornburg v. Gingles in 1986, which
   established the test to evaluate claims of racial vote dilution in
   district boundaries. To establish a Section 2 violation under Gingles,
   plaintiffs must show that instead of the challenged map or boundaries
   which dilute the power of voters of color, an acceptable district could
   be drawn that would allow voters of color to elect a candidate of
   choice.

Merrill v. Milligan

   On October 4, 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Merrill
   v. Milligan. Plaintiffs -- Alabama voters and voting rights
   organizations -- challenged the congressional map passed by the Alabama
   legislature after the 2020 census. The new map maintained only one
   majority-Black congressional district out of seven total districts,
   despite the fact that 27% of the Alabama population is Black. This
   percentage suggests that there could -- and, according to the Milligan
   plaintiffs, should -- be two districts where Black voters can elect a
   candidate of choice. After the presentation of evidence, a three-judge
   panel at the district court found a likely Section 2 violation and
   irreparable harm to Black voters. The court ordered lawmakers to draw a
   new map that satisfies the requirements of Section 2.

   Instead of accepting the ruling and working to address the violation on
   behalf of the state's Black voters, the state filed an emergency appeal
   to the Supreme Court to halt the lower court order suspending Alabama's
   map. The Supreme Court agreed, which meant that the Alabama
   congressional map, which a three-judge panel had struck down at the
   federal district court, would be in place for the upcoming 2022
   election season. On October 4, 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral
   arguments.

   demanding fair maps

   Merrill v. Milligan is a straightforward vote dilution case, with an
   outcome dictated by Supreme Court precedent. As Justice Kagan noted
   during oral arguments, "this case should be a slam dunk." Even Chief
   Justice Roberts agreed in his dissent to the emergency stay order,
   stating, "the District Court properly applied existing law in an
   extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction." So why
   is the Supreme Court hearing this case?

   The state argues that its "race-neutral" map -- which only creates one
   majority-Black congressional district -- should not be disqualified
   just because it is possible to draw two majority-Black districts in
   Alabama. They suggest that the VRA prohibits denying votes on account
   of race but does not affirmatively obligate states to redistrict on
   account of race. The state urges that the first prong of the Gingles
   test, that the community of color must be "sufficiently large and
   geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member
   district," should be a race-blind test. Alabama's argument does not
   square with the purpose and history of the VRA, which is specifically
   focused on rooting out racialdiscrimination in voting pursuant to
   Congress's power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.

   Alabama voters in the Milligan case argue that Alabama violated Section
   2 by [44]"packing" and "cracking" Black residents to limit their
   political power. Importantly, they also argue that requiring the first
   prong of Gingles to be race-blind would defeat the purpose of Section
   2, which is to protect voters of color from having their political
   power diminished. During oral argument, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji
   Brown Jackson acknowledged the historical importance of race in VRA
   case law, noting that "it became clear to me that the framers
   themselves adopted the equal protection clause, the Fourteenth
   Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, in a race-conscious way. That they
   were, in fact, trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated
   against . . . were brought equal to everyone else in the society."

   [45]Learn More About Our Legal Cases

   The League of Women Voters of Alabama and the League of Women Voters of
   the United States filed an amicus brief supporting Alabama voters in
   the case, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center and Stand-Up
   Mobile. The League's brief urges the Supreme Court to uphold the
   district court ruling, which found a violation of Section 2. The brief
   explains how a second majority-Black district can be drawn to satisfy
   Section 2 by combining two communities in Alabama with deep ties to
   each other: the city of Mobile and Alabama's Black Belt. [46]The brief
   can be found here.

What's Next?

   It's essential that the Supreme Court uphold the Alabama district court
   ruling and protect the longstanding protections Section 2 provides for
   voters. Should the Court rule in Alabama's favor, future rulings
   striking down racially discriminatory redistricting plans could be put
   at risk. This is already occurring: in June 2022, [47]a district court
   in Louisiana found a Section 2 violation for that state's congressional
   map, but the decision has stayed pending the outcoming in Milligan. The
   racially discriminatory Louisiana congressional map has thus been
   allowed to go into effect for the 2022 election season. If the Supreme
   Court rules in favor of Alabama, the Louisiana case could suffer the
   same fate.

   This case emphasizes the importance of restoring the Voting Rights Act
   to its full strength and passing federal voting rights protections.
   Encourage your representatives to do so: let Congress know they must
   pass the [48]John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom
   to Vote Act to protect voters from discriminatory and suppressive
   voting practices.

   A decision in Merrill v. Milligan is expected in the spring or summer
   of 2023.

UN Report: US fails to implement terms of treaty on eliminating racial
discrimination

   September 09, 2022
   [62]Lisa Borden
   [63]Lisa Borden
   Senior Policy Counsel for International Advocacy

   A United Nations committee that is reviewing U.S. compliance with an
   international treaty on racialdiscrimination has issued findings that
   should be seen as a serious rebuke and wakeup call for the Biden
   administration.

   The final report of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial
   Discrimination ([64]CERD), issued on Aug. 30, criticized the systemic
   and longstanding failure of the U.S. to take compliance with the treaty
   seriously and to develop mechanisms to integrate its goals into
   domestic policy.

   In its [65]concluding observations and recommendations regarding the
   U.S., the committee raised significant concerns about compliance with
   nearly every aspect of the [66]International Convention on the
   Elimination of All Forms of racialdiscrimination.

   Especially noteworthy was CERD's focus on issues contained in specific
   recommendations that the Southern Poverty Law Center submitted to the
   committee earlier in August. These issues included hate and extremism
   as well as racial disparities in voting, health care, education, the
   criminal legal system and immigration.

   The SPLC [67]went to Geneva, Switzerland, as part of a coalition of
   more than 70 advocates from U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations
   (NGOs), to provide documentation to CERD of ongoing racial
   discrimination and disparities in the U.S. We submitted [68]three
   reports in advance of the review and traveled with a [69]delegation
   that included two formerly incarcerated people who shared their
   experiences with committee members.

   We're pleased that CERD embraced many of our policy recommendations on
   the issues we raised. We will now work with coalition partners to urge
   the Biden administration to translate those recommendations into
   concrete policy changes.

   At the same time, it's deeply troubling that the U.S. has not done more
   to implement the treaty, the oldest of nine core international human
   rights accords. The U.S. has ratified only three of the nine. The U.S.
   signed the treaty on racialdiscrimination in 1966 but did not ratify
   it until 1994.

General failure to implement the treaty

   At the outset, the committee reiterated concerns it had expressed in
   past reviews about the continued failure of the U.S. to incorporate the
   treaty into domestic law and policy, specifically mentioning its
   notable absence from President Joe Biden's [70]Executive Order on
   Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through
   the Federal Government.

   The SPLC has repeatedly raised this issue, not only in our reports to
   CERD but also directly to various U.S. officials.

   Even though the U.S. has signed and ratified the treaty, Congress has
   never taken any steps to incorporate its requirements into U.S.
   legislation, and no administration has made an effort to do the same
   when developing and implementing domestic policy. This means that the
   treaty is in force on paper, but any instance of compliance with its
   requirements is merely coincidental.

   The committee also regretted the continued failure of the United States
   to create a national human rights institution (NHRI) or any similar
   coordinating mechanism to monitor implementation of the treaty.
   Additionally, the committee lamented the continued absence of a
   comprehensive national action plan to combat systemic racism and
   structural discrimination. It urged the U.S. to proceed on both fronts.

   The U.S. has long declined to establish any federal mechanism to
   coordinate and monitor implementation of any of its international human
   rights treaty obligations, claiming that agency-level oversight of
   related domestic laws and regulations is sufficient. That claim is
   clearly mistaken, given the results of CERD's review and the failure of
   the federal government to even consider these treaties when fashioning
   domestic policy.

   Notably, a White House representative who was part of the president's
   Geneva delegation told the committee during the review that the
   administration would consider proceeding with a study of how best to
   create an NHRI - a welcome departure from the intentions expressed by
   the administration during pre-review consultations, when the same
   person told NGO representatives that there were no plans to pursue
   this.

   The committee also recommended that the U.S. consult with NGOs
   regarding the creation and implementation of a national action plan to
   combat systemic racism and structural discrimination.

Hate and extremism

   Unique among the nations, hate speech in the United States is broadly
   protected by the First Amendment.

   The committee raised its perennial concerns about this and recommended
   action to confront the prevalence of hate speech, including by public
   officials and politicians, and to establish mechanisms to collect data
   on hate incidents (something the SPLC has supported).

   The committee also raised concerns about the increased activity of
   white supremacists and violent extremist groups. While recognizing the
   important progress made by the enactment of the [71]COVID-19 Hate
   Crimes Act (legislation that authorizes incentive grants to spark
   improved local and state hate crime training, prevention, best
   practices and data collection initiatives), the committee echoed SPLC
   concerns about consistent underreporting of hate crimes and recommended
   establishing a comprehensive data collection system that is either
   mandatory or that conditions federal funding on credible participation
   - a recommendation we had made to the committee in our submission.

   The SPLC's recommendations in this arena likely contributed to the
   committee's own, unusually strong and specific proposals for action.
   What's more, the committee recommended mandatory hate crime training
   for all law enforcement officials.

Voting rights

   Threats to voting rights are a major source of concern for the SPLC and
   have been the focus of several of our submissions to international
   human rights bodies, including CERD.

   The committee expressed concerns about the prevalence of state voter
   suppression laws and provided a laundry list of specific suppression
   measures that need attention, all of which had been addressed in our
   report. It recommended restoring the Voting Rights Act and taking other
   measures, including federal legislation, to eliminate unreasonable
   restrictions on the right to vote.

   Echoing concerns that were also addressed in a statement by our
   community partner [72]Page Dukes, a member of the SPLC delegation, the
   committee specifically recommended steps to ensure that people
   convicted of felonies have their voting rights restored upon completion
   of their incarceration and that the federal government review state
   laws that provide for the automatic disenfranchisement of those who are
   incarcerated.

Prisons

   The committee raised concerns about the continued overrepresentation of
   racial and ethnic minorities in the prison population and specifically
   about their being disproportionately held in solitary confinement for
   long periods of time. SPLC community partner [73]Terrance Winn, also a
   member of the SPLC delegation, told the committee of being locked up in
   solitary confinement numerous times at Angola prison in Louisiana
   during his 30-year incarceration.

   Further reflecting Winn's testimony, the committee raised concerns
   about prison labor practices, especially the lack of adequate pay and
   other labor protections.

   It also addressed the disproportionate impact of collateral
   consequences including housing, employment and access to government
   benefits, and expressed concerns about the prosecution of juveniles in
   adult courts. The committee recommended strict limitations on the use
   of solitary confinement in line with the U.N.'s [74]Mandela Rules,
   which provide standards for the treatment of incarcerated people, and
   urged full compliance with the Mandela Rules on prison labor.

Health care

   In alignment with our submission on racial disparities in health care,
   the committee expressed concerns about lack of access to adequate
   health care in states that did not expand Medicaid, recommending
   expanded coverage programs to ensure that everyone has such access.

   Our submission to the committee on health care disparities also
   included information on racially disparate maternal and infant
   mortality rates and the impact that the Supreme Court's [75]Dobbs
   decision and state abortion restrictions will have on health and health
   care in the Deep South states where we work. We were pleased to see
   that that the committee raised the same concerns and urged measures to
   combat the racially disproportionate impact of these issues.

Immigration

   On migration issues, the committee expressed concerns about mandatory
   detention and detention conditions, including the lack of access to
   counsel, violence against undocumented migrants by immigration
   enforcement officers and disparate treatment of Black and Brown
   migrants.

   It recommended ending mandatory detention and criminal prosecution for
   illegal entry and ensuring due process and access to counsel. The
   committee also raised concerns about impunity for abuses against
   migrants by U.S. immigration enforcement officers and recommended that
   the U.S. undertake measures to prevent and to properly investigate and
   provide accountability for improper uses of force.

Education

   As reflected in the SPLC's submission, the committee stated concerns
   about state-level measures to prohibit school instruction about race,
   discrimination, privilege and oppression, and about book banning and
   intimidation of teachers and school administrators. It recommended that
   the U.S. take all measures necessary to ensure that human rights
   education, including race discrimination and the history of slavery and
   colonialism, is part of all school curricula, and to afford adequate
   protections for educators from harassment, intimidation and violence.

   In addition, the committee echoed the concerns raised in our
   recommendations about education funding disparities and private school
   voucher programs that are exacerbating racial segregation in schools
   around the country.

   It was also concerned about racially disproportionate school discipline
   and policing.

   The committee recommended development of a comprehensive national plan
   on socioeconomic and racial school segregation, along with measures to
   pressure states to address funding disparities and to combat school
   discipline and juvenile justice disparities.

What comes next

   Following the review, the committee recommended that the U.S. continue,
   and increase, its consultations with civil society organizations such
   as the SPLC and other human rights-oriented NGOs.

   The SPLC and other NGOs will press the administration to begin this
   process quickly and to ensure that it is much more substantive than it
   has been in the past.

   As part of the review process, the committee identified some of its
   recommendations - involving maternal and reproductive health, the
   rights of Indigenous people and the rights of migrants - to be the
   subject of follow-up reporting by the U.S. in one year.

   Given the dire threats to voting rights and the urgency of addressing
   them, we had hoped that voting rights would be a part of the one-year
   follow-up. But it's difficult to decide which fires should be
   extinguished first, and these are all vitally important issues.

   The next regular periodic report, which will begin the review process
   again, is to be submitted by Nov. 20, 2025. Until then, there is much
   to be done to begin the long overdue process of meaningful
   implementation of the treaty.

   Elimination of All Forms of racialdiscrimination in 1966, the U.S. has
   failed to incorporate the treaty's requirements into domestic policy,
   according to a U.N. committee's new report. (Credit: iStock/Nobilior

Terminated contractor files case against USA Cricket for 'racial
discrimination'

   The lawsuit, filed by Kirk Greaves, seeks a total of $2 million dollars
   in damages

   Kirk Greaves (C) was terminated from an independent contractor role
   early last month, Lauderhill, December 23, 2021

   Kirk Greaves (middle) on December 23, 2021, in Lauderhill, Florida, at
   a T20I between USA and Ireland   o   Peter Della Penna
   In the midst of a [78]protracted legal battle regarding the delayed
   general elections from 2020, USA Cricket now has a second lawsuit on
   its hands after Kirk Greaves, who was terminated from an
   independent-contractor role early last month, filed legal action in the
   US Federal Court against the national governing body claiming "racial
   discrimination in employment".
   The lawsuit, which was filed by Greaves on April 28 in the Northern
   District of California (USA Cricket is headquartered in San Francisco)
   is seeking a total of $2 million dollars in damages: $150,000 in
   economic damages owing to lost future wages; $350,000 in non-economic
   damages for "psychological stress and humiliation"; and $1.5 million in
   punitive damages.
   "USA Cricket is aware of various details of a lawsuit being brought by
   a former contractor against USA Cricket," a USA Cricket spokesperson
   said to ESPNcricinfo in an emailed statement. "The individual is one of
   a number of contractors previously engaged by USA Cricket whose
   contracts were recently not renewed. All allegations in the lawsuit are
   entirely false and without merit, and USA Cricket denies and will
   aggressively defend against them. The matter is currently in the hands
   of USA Cricket's lawyers. We look forward to the case being dismissed
   in due course and will not be making any further comment at this time."
   Prior to working for USA Cricket, Greaves, a native of Barbados, worked
   as Team Operations Manager for Barbados Tridents for three seasons in
   the Caribbean Premier League from 2016 to 2018. He was also appointed
   as Tournament Operations Manager for the Global T20 Canada when it
   launched in 2018 and worked in an operations role for Rajasthan Royals
   during the 2019 IPL. According to the lawsuit, Greaves claims he was
   brought on board by USA Cricket as an independent contractor for a
   four-month probationary period as a Cricket Operations Manager
   beginning in March 2021 at an initial wage of $5,000 per month and
   tasked with executing four domestic cricket tournaments.
   Greaves claims a verbal agreement was in place with then board CEO Iain
   Higgins to give him an offer of full-time employment, contingent upon
   the successful completion of the four domestic tournaments. However,
   Greaves was never subsequently presented with a full-time job offer and
   claims that the budget which was allegedly allocated for the role was
   instead repackaged as an increased salary offer to a white employee.
   Among other allegations, Greaves states that he was subjected to a
   "toxic work environment, unfair employment practices, wage disparity
   and discrimination". Greaves claims that he was the only black staff
   member and also the only American citizen on staff and, as such, he was
   "hired to diversify the management of USA Cricket. It would appear that
   only the Australians, Indians, New Zealanders and other non-Americans
   have benefitted from the USA Cricket brand".
   Though their employment status is not considered full-time, USA Cricket
   currently has three other black men - who are all American citizens -
   serving in staff leadership roles affiliated with its national teams:
   John Aaron as USA Women's national team manager, Kerk Higgins as USA
   men's national team manager, and Kevin Darlington in the dual role of
   USA men's assistant coach and USA U-19 men's head coach.
   Greaves also claims in the suit that he suffered humiliation after
   having his role reclassified from "Cricket Operations Manager" to
   "Events Manager", and that the renaming of his role resulted in
   "eliminating any element of black representation at the senior
   management level", something he claims "was racially orchestrated and
   violated US law". Greaves also writes that his job status was that of a
   permanent employee but claims that classifying him as an independent
   contractor "demonstrates bad faith and is a contravention of US labor
   laws".
   On March 28, a letter was sent by USA Cricket Operations Director
   Richard Done to Greaves notifying him that his independent contractor
   agreement - which had been $6,500 for the final five months, an
   increase of $1,500 above his original - was being terminated as of
   April 8, "pursuant to the decision of the Cricket Committee". However,
   Greaves claims that he received an email disputing this from USA
   Cricket board member Srini Salver. In the email, which is attached in
   an exhibit as part of the lawsuit filing, Salver writes to Greaves that
   "your termination was never recommended by the Cricket Committee" in
   any board meeting but was instead discussed during a conversation about
   budgets.
   "The budget isn't approved, nor are the terminations," Salver allegedly
   wrote to Greaves. Salver is one of the two board member plaintiffs,
   along with Venu Pisike, in the ongoing legal action filed against five
   other USA board members and then USA Cricket CEO Iain Higgins over the
   legality of new members being allowed voting status in the case about
   the delayed elections from 2020.
   A court hearing date for the Greaves lawsuit has been set for August 2.

Are Asian Americans victims of racism or beneficiaries of whiteness? It's
complex.

It's time to discard this simplistic dichotomy.

   A question that seems to be asked with increasing frequency is whether
   Asian Americans are the beneficiaries of privileges historically
   afforded to white people in the United States or if we are the victims
   of racialdiscrimination. But reality is much more complex. It's time
   to discard this simplistic dichotomy.

   Take the [124]Students for Fair Admissions v[125]. Harvard case to be
   heard in the US Supreme Court in October. Plaintiffs in the case argue
   that Asian Americans experience racialdiscrimination in Harvard
   admissions, as evidenced, they claim, by admitted Asian American
   students' higher GPAs and SAT scores compared to admitted students of
   all other races, including white students. They also point to
   admissions officers' lower "personal" ratings of Asian American
   applicants compared to those of other students. Harvard and its
   defenders have responded in part by pointing to the [126]increasing
   percentage of Asian Americans admitted every year. The university also
   points out that academics are not the only criterion they use to admit
   students.

   In 2019, federal Judge Allison Burroughs [127]affirmed Harvard's
   admissions practices as legally sound in her ruling but also recognized
   the [128]possibility of anti-Asian discrimination in "personal"
   ratings. Asian Americans also experience [129]glass ceilings in
   corporate firms and [130]bullying in schools. Since the onset of the
   COVID-19 pandemic, Asian Americans have experienced increased
   [131]physical attacks. It's clear that anti-Asian discrimination is
   real. A high percentage of Asian American students admitted to Harvard
   does not preclude the possibility of anti-Asian racism.

   On the other hand, Asian Americans' overall high SAT scores and GPAs
   are driven, in part, by privileges made for and normally afforded to
   middle-class white Americans. Many Asian Americans have been able to
   benefit from these advantages. Why? US immigration policy has meant
   that [132]a large proportion of immigrants from Asia come with college
   and even graduate degrees. High incomes enable a significant number of
   them to move to [133]well-off suburbs historically designed as islands
   of privilege for upper-middle-class white people leaving
   [134]integrated cities.

   Those municipalities have, for decades, been able to offer a top-notch
   public education -- they can provide more opportunities given their
   high tax bases -- and they have fewer poverty-related challenges to
   address, as well. Those advantages -- along with highly skilled Asian
   parents' dexterity in educational testing (that's what got them into
   top colleges in Asia) and [135]positive stereotypes teachers often have
   about Asian Americans' academic capability -- facilitate Asian American
   kids' high levels of academic achievement. In this regard, Asian
   Americans do indeed benefit from [136]"whiteness" as a system of
   advantage. In other words, the US education system has racially unequal
   opportunities and hence outcomes baked into it, and Asian Americans
   have actually benefited from that racial inequality that historically
   has privileged white students over Black and Latinx students.

   Taking this history into account when making admissions decisions means
   we'd expect Asian American and white students' SAT scores and GPAs to
   be higher than those of Black, Latinx, and Native American students on
   average. Of course, [137]Asian Americans are diverse, and working-class
   Asian Americans do not experience the benefits of living in well-off
   neighborhoods, even if [138]some may benefit from teachers' positive
   stereotypes about Asian Americans' academic capabilities.

   I found these dual forces of race operating in [139]my own research in
   a well-off East Coast suburb with a large and growing Asian American
   population. This was a town that, [140]like many affluent suburbs
   around the country -- from San Jose, Calif., to Weston, Mass. -- had
   many years ago passed laws to prevent working-class people from moving
   in, such as minimum housing lot size requirements and limits on the
   building of multifamily homes. The historical record shows that laws
   like these and [141]the choices many white Americans made (and continue
   to make) about where to live were frequently related to a desire to
   steer clear of Black people in particular. Many suburban properties
   even had explicit racially restrictive covenants, which barred the sale
   of those properties to Black buyers. These covenants were legal until
   the Fair Housing Act of 1968.

   Even today, Black middle-class professionals frequently do not choose
   to live in towns like the one I studied, in part because [142]they
   understand the problems likely to ensue if their children do not have
   peers who share their racial identity. [143]Racial steering by real
   estate agents also keeps them away.

   But Asian Americans have had a different experience in the United
   States. The history of residential segregation between Black and white
   Americans, ironically, enabled Asian American professionals to reap the
   benefits of living in communities segregated by class and previously by
   race. Some see evidence like this as meaning that Asian Americans are
   "white adjacent."

   But [144]in my research I also found evidence of anti-Asian racism.
   Many white parents expressed disdain for Asian American parenting,
   which, they observed, enabled Asian American students to outperform
   white students academically. For example, one white mom complained to
   me about the presence of kids whose parents had academic standards she
   deemed unreasonably high, describing one to me by saying, "her name is
   not Sally Smith. ... It's never the blonde Norwegian."

   To be sure, anti-Asian American racism is not the same as anti-Black
   racism. The two are driven by different stereotypes and appear in
   different spheres of social life. There is no point in trying to
   measure whether one is "worse" than the other. They are different, and
   we must find ways for both to end.

   To do so, we must stop assuming that Asian American academic
   achievement means the end of anti-Asian racism or that Asian Americans
   sometimes benefiting from privileges previously reserved for white
   Americans means we always benefit from the privileges of whiteness. The
   multifaceted nature of racialdiscrimination and privilege in the
   United States is far more complex. To tackle it, we need to understand
   its diverse faces.

   The impact of COVID-19 has been disproportionately felt by populations
   experiencing structural racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination.
   Here, we describe opportunities for COVID-19 response and recovery
   efforts to help build more equal and resilient societies, through
   investments in: (i) interventions focused on explicitly addressing
   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination; (ii) interventions
   supporting the delivery of universal services, and in ways that address
   compounding and intersecting drivers of exclusion and marginalization;
   and (iii) cross-cutting enabling measures, such as participatory
   mechanisms and data disaggregation.

   More than two years since the first SARS-CoV-2 infections were
   reported, the COVID-19 pandemic remains an acute global
   emergency^[73]1. While many countries have successfully vaccinated
   significant portions of their populations, stark global inequities
   remain with imbalance in the global distribution of
   vaccines^[74]2,[75]3, and potential new variants could further threaten
   the ability of governments to recover from the inter-connected health,
   economic, and broader human rights crises. Within countries, the impact
   of COVID-19 has been disproportionately felt by populations
   experiencing structural racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination.
   Indeed, where disaggregated epidemiologic data are available, COVID-19
   morbidity and mortality rates are often significantly higher among
   people of African descent, indigenous peoples, and ethnic groups or
   other minoritized groups experiencing discrimination^[76]4,[77]5,[78]6.
   This reflects what social epidemiologists have long recognized: disease
   distribution is patterned by structures of disadvantage, inequality,
   marginalization and discrimination that often have historical roots and
   still have present-day manifestations^[79]7. Importantly, "race" is
   purely a social construct that has no biological basis, and documented
   racial inequities are due to racism not genetics or biology.

   Ethnicity-based and racialdiscrimination intersects with other forms
   of exclusion based on income, occupation, gender identity and
   expression, sexual orientation, disability, religion or belief,
   language, migratory status, rural/urban status and more, and is
   unlikely to exist in only one sector. Beyond health inequities,
   COVID-19 racial and ethnicity-based inequities have been documented
   across employment, education, housing and food insecurity, among other
   domains^[80]8. There are different pathways - from differential
   exposure, to inequitable access to health services, to uneven
   socioeconomic impacts of control measures, that can be further studied
   to inform policymaking, planning and programming^[81]9. Yet, these
   unequal impacts and human rights violations are not inevitable; neither
   is a spike in xenophobia and hate speech^[82]10.

   As countries work to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and
   address both health challenges and broader socio-economic impacts,
   attention must be given to tackling racial and ethnic discrimination.
   With this in mind, and consistent with the UN Secretary General's Call
   to Action for Human Rights^[83]11, members of the United Nations
   Sustainable Development Group released a report on opportunities to
   address racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination^[84]12.

   The report was developed through a consultative process that began in
   late 2020 through early 2021, involving UN senior executives and
   technical staff, civil society, public health practitioners and human
   rights experts. It identified three strategic approaches to addressing
   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination in COVID-19 response and
   recovery efforts. These are: (i) interventions explicitly tackling
   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination, including improving
   anti-discrimination and redress mechanisms; (ii) interventions
   supporting the delivery of universal services, but in ways that address
   compounding and intersecting drivers of social exclusion and draw on
   the framework of proportionate universalism^[85]13; and (iii)
   investments in cross-cutting enabling measures, such as participatory
   mechanisms and data disaggregation (see Table [86]1 which is replicated
   from the report).
   Table 1 Summary of potential entry points to address racial- and
   ethnicity-based discrimination, replicated from UN report.
   [87]Full size table

   While not exhaustive and recognizing that entry-points would need to be
   tailored to national circumstances and developed in consultation with
   impacted communities, these mutually reinforcing entry-points together
   offer a framework to address discrimination directly through targeted
   measures, and indirectly through universal measures that will have
   amplified impacts on disadvantaged populations. This framework is
   currently being used in a capacity-building programme for United
   Nations Country Teams to support national policies and programmes that
   result in more just, equal and resilient societies. To date, thirteen
   UN Country Teams have participated in the programme and a
   training-of-trainers is planned for late 2022 to reach more, under the
   umbrella of the UN Network on addressing racialdiscrimination and the
   Protection of Minorities.

Explicitly tackle racial and ethnicity-based discrimination

   COVID-19 made clear that there is a need for explicit policies to
   tackle racial and ethnicity-based discrimination in the immediate term,
   to address current pressing needs, and in the long term. The
   longstanding impact of colonialism, theft of land, resources and
   exclusionary actions, for example, left indigenous peoples more
   vulnerable to COVID-19. Indigenous peoples already faced numerous
   obstacles to equitably accessing health services, including because of
   geographical barriers posed by the organization of provider networks,
   difficulty affording medical care, or difficulties in accessing
   culturally appropriate care that is in their own language and that
   respects their cultural beliefs, traditions and practices^[88]14.
   During the COVID-19 pandemic the world also witnessed a rise in
   episodes of xenophobia, hate speech, abuses, assaults, harassment,
   scapegoating, stigmatization and increase in excessive immigration
   control measures^[89]15.

   Countries can use this opportunity of heightened sensitivity to health
   inequities to adopt or strengthen existing anti-discrimination laws and
   policies that align with international human rights standards. These
   should extend beyond health care to address discrimination in the
   workplace, housing, education, law enforcement and border control
   sectors, among others. States must meet their obligations to respect,
   protect and fulfill the rights of everyone guaranteed under the
   International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial
   Discrimination by, for example, equipping existing autonomous national
   institutions to guarantee protection, effective implementation of
   anti-discrimination laws and policies, and access to justice for
   individual or collective complaints.

   Accurate communications and public messages centered on solidarity,
   tolerance, and inclusion are needed to combat scapegoating, `othering'
   or victim-blaming narratives that continue to exacerbate harm. Just as
   with past epidemics which have often resulted in human rights abuses
   and discriminatory enforcement of public health measures, as well as
   segregationist public health strategies^[90]16, concerns were raised
   around emergency measures inappropriately targeting groups, including
   migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and the excessive and selective
   use of police and military for enforcement^[91]17. For example,
   longstanding anti-Roma racism in Europe, including violent and targeted
   oppression over centuries, resurfaced through inflammatory rhetoric and
   scapegoating during COVID-19^[92]18.

Addressing compounding and intersecting drivers of exclusion

   COVID-19 made inequities experienced by persons facing ethnicity-based
   and racialdiscrimination more visible, but unfair and discriminatory
   practices in education, housing, labor markets, the criminal justice
   system, to name a few, are often overlapping and compounding, and did
   not emerge simply as a result of the pandemic. Universal and
   rights-based strategies such as temporary moratoria on
   evictions^[93]19, expanded social protection nets, enhanced labor
   protections including for workers in the informal economy, expansion of
   free Wi-Fi and open education resources, release and decarceration
   efforts - among other measures - can have a differential positive
   impact on populations experiencing racial and ethnicity-based
   discrimination. This is because structural racism acts to skew
   distributions such that excluded and marginalized groups are
   over-represented among those working in the informal economy, those
   facing housing insecurity, those deprived of education, those living in
   poverty and those facing obstacles to justice. An intersectional
   analysis to comprehensively address the multiple and overlapping
   structural drivers of inequality, for example with regards to gender
   identity, religion, ableness, or citizenship status, in addition to
   race and ethnicity, is essential in COVID-19 recovery plans.

   Place-based strategies^[94]20, including neighborhood and
   community-based interventions, can similarly help mitigate the
   disproportionate impact of COVID-19 in geographic regions that have
   historically been underserved and contain large numbers of people that
   may have experienced racial and ethnicity-based discrimination. For
   example, investments in infrastructure, including health
   infrastructure, can help to ensure basic minimum needs for shelter,
   health, water, sanitation and hygiene are being met during and
   following the pandemic, while also generating employment opportunities
   in the immediate term for residents of underserved areas.

Invest in enabling and human rights-based approaches

   Although there are both direct and indirect strategies through which
   plans to build forward better from the COVID-19 pandemic can begin to
   address structural racism and ethnicity-based discrimination, as
   described above, these actions will only be successful if they address
   power inequities and are developed through participatory and inclusive
   approaches, ensuring historically excluded communities have
   decision-making power and adequate resources. COVID-19 response and
   recovery plans could earmark resources for civil society organizations
   working to address discrimination, social exclusion and human rights.

   In the immediate term, investments in systems to disaggregate data by
   race and/or ethnicity, as well as other dimensions that can help
   address the intersectional impact on particular groups, are needed. It
   is essential that these are accompanied by investments in data
   protection. These investments and other equity analysis tools can help
   unpack inequalities across groups both as a direct result of COVID-19
   and because of unevenly distributed impacts of pandemic-related
   measures and uneven socioeconomic consequences. Importantly, mechanisms
   for transparent data reporting that allow for public accountability
   will be critical. In many contexts, investment in vital statistics and
   civil registration will also be needed, since the pandemic highlighted
   that many people in need of emergency social protection were unable to
   access benefits because they lacked proper identification^[95]21.
   Similarly, efforts should be made to ensure that the needs of those
   with precarious legal identity status are also met.

Conclusion

   Inequalities in who gets sick and who suffers long-term socioeconomic
   consequences during and following a pandemic are largely shaped by
   unequal political power dynamics and how societies structure their
   economies, laws and policies and broader governance mechanisms. This
   tragic pandemic has further shone the light on grave and historic
   injustices and inequalities, both within and across countries, and
   should be an impetus for countries to strengthen their efforts to
   address systemic racism and ethnicity-based discrimination. Lessons
   learned from the COVID-19 pandemic also include the importance of
   prevention and the high cost of inaction. Parallels can easily be drawn
   around the need for urgent and concerted action to address the climate
   emergency if we are to prevent the unnecessary and unequal health
   impact of climate change^[96]22. This opportunity should not be wasted.

On the International Stage: SPLC to present evidence of systemic racism in US
to UN committee in Geneva

   August 05, 2022
   Esther Schrader

   When Terrance Winn takes a seat on a flight to Geneva this month as
   part of a Southern Poverty Law Center delegation traveling to address a
   United Nations committee, it will be an extraordinary departure for a
   man who until two years ago had been incarcerated for 30 years.

   But as he looks out over the ocean separating himself from his former
   life, Winn will be a fitting symbol of the departure the delegation
   represents for the SPLC. Long rooted in advocating for racial justice
   at home, the organization will for the first time formally appeal to an
   international body to recognize systemic racism in the United States as
   a human rights emergency of global concern.

   [62]Winn, who was released two years ago from the vast Louisiana State
   Penitentiary known as "Angola," has become a widely respected advocate
   for prison reform.

   Several members of the SPLC's leadership team will accompany Winn.
   Leading the delegation is Lisa Borden, senior policy counsel. Borden
   heads the SPLC's new international advocacy initiative -- established
   last December. A civil rights lawyer in Alabama for three decades,
   Borden joined the SPLC last year and is charged with using the pressure
   of international condemnation as a powerful new mechanism for advocacy
   in a country where democratic institutions are in peril.

   Also with the delegation will be SPLC Chief Policy Officer LaShawn
   Warren, along with [63]Page Dukes, a formerly incarcerated Georgia
   woman who since 2019 has worked on voting rights and other issues at
   the [64]Southern Center for Human Rights.

   Together the delegation will carve a new path for an organization that
   -- since its founding in 1971 as a small law firm working to help
   implement federal civil rights legislation and constitutional
   guarantees -- has focused its [65]legal work within the U.S., even as
   it evolved into a powerful advocate for the human rights of all people.

   Now, the SPLC is looking to international institutions for added focus
   on the dearth of justice experienced by many in the Deep South and
   across the U.S.

   "We have always had people who bring the question of justice to the
   courts, and we have always had people who work on policy, on the state
   level and more recently on the federal level," Borden said. "Now we
   want to bring the gaze of our international peers to the deep issues of
   civil and political rights plaguing America."

Seeking international pressure

   The occasion is the 107th session of the [66]U.N. Committee on the
   Elimination of racialdiscrimination (CERD), a body of independent
   experts that monitors implementation of the [67]International
   Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of racialdiscrimination.
   The treaty has been signed by 128 countries, including the U.S., and is
   the oldest and most widely ratified U.N. rights convention.

   Governments party to the treaty come under review by CERD regularly,
   generally every four years. Along with reports submitted by the
   governments, human rights organizations like the SPLC can submit their
   own reports, giving their perspectives, concerns and evidence of the
   country, its public officials or institutions engaging in racial
   discrimination against individuals, groups of people or organizations.

   The committee issues recommendations based on the reports it receives.
   Though it has no mechanism to enforce those recommendations, the
   pressure of its public reports can have an impact.

   The U.S. has an ambivalent history with CERD. It signed the treaty in
   1966, but Congress did not ratify it for nearly three decades -- until
   Oct. 21, 1994. And while the treaty commits the U.S. to "adopt all
   necessary measures for speedily eliminating racialdiscrimination," the
   American Bar Association found in 2020 that the U.S. "has consistently
   failed to meaningfully uphold this mandate."

   Since ratifying the treaty, the U.S. has nullified its impact by
   submitting reservations, failing to enact anti-racism legislation,
   preventing citizens from bringing claims under the treaty and failing
   to deliver timely reports of measures it has taken to address racial
   discrimination.

   During the administration of former President Donald Trump, CERD's work
   was ignored entirely. The U.S. was to have submitted a report to it in
   2018 but did not begin working on one until President Joe Biden took
   office in January 2021. The Biden administration has pledged a new
   level of commitment to CERD.

`Move the needle'

   Back when those pledges by the new administration were being made, Winn
   was recently out of prison, home in Shreveport, Louisiana, for the
   first time since he was arrested at age 16 and convicted of murder
   after a fight broke out between him and another man and an innocent
   bystander was killed. Now 48, he is the executive director of a
   nonprofit organization he created -- Priorities, Intentions and
   Practical Exchanges (PIPE) -- which seeks to keep young people out of
   prison and to help people recently released.

   Penitentiary, has become a widely respected advocate for prison reform

   Winn will speak to CERD about conditions in U.S. prisons and about the
   toll on incarcerated people who have been subjected to solitary
   confinement. Winn said he spent more than half his 30 years of
   incarceration in solitary, much of it at Angola, the largest
   penitentiary in the U.S. Built on the site of a former plantation,
   Angola is infamous for its harsh conditions.

   Despite the hardship he endured, Winn was able to emerge from prison
   with a GED diploma, then a culinary degree. Now he is a student at
   Houston Community College. Eventually, Winn said, he hopes to go to law
   school. He received special permission from his parole board to travel
   to Geneva.

   "What is the message I am bringing [to the United Nations committee]?
   That the U.S. calls itself the leader of the free world, and it will
   put any country on trial that doesn't treat its people right, but,
   well, the U.S. isn't treating its own people right," Winn said.

   "Let's look at the fact that in disproportionate numbers a Black person
   is going to go to prison in his lifetime, especially in the South. And
   once they get there, they are going to see barbarity, they are going to
   see corruption, they are going to - well, they might not go insane, but
   I can tell you from my own life, they are going to experience moments
   of insanity. How is that making us a model for the free world?"

   The SPLC is filing reports to the committee that ask the same questions
   about a series of pressing issues topping its agenda. Among them are
   the discrimination and abuse of Black migrants to the U.S.; the impact
   of mass incarceration on children and families; the use of corporal
   punishment in schools; voter suppression and disenfranchisement of
   voters with felony convictions; the vast disparities in education and
   health care funding; the impact on minority communities of the denial
   of abortion care; and the stark rise in recent years in hate speech and
   hate crimes.

   "Taking a stand for accountability and integrity in our own nation is
   central to the mission of the SPLC today," said Warren, the SPLC's
   chief policy officer. "We cannot hold other countries to standards that
   we are not applying to ourselves."

   The goal of the reports and the first-person testimony by people like
   Winn and [68]Dukes is "to move the needle," Borden said.

   "Anybody who engages in international human rights advocacy or any type
   of diplomacy, you have to be someone who can accept incremental
   change," Borden said. "But what we want is for the committee to
   understand what has gone wrong and for them to adopt specific
   recommendations that we and other organizations make about what the
   U.S. can and should do, because those are the tools we can then use to
   push the White House, the State Department, to talk to other agencies,
   even to talk to members of Congress about what it should really mean
   for the U.S. to call itself a human rights leader around the world."

Family of 10-year-old accused of groping school employee fights allegations,
racialdiscrimination
     __________________________________________________________________

   [22]Danielle Johnson   | The Daytona Beach News-Journal

   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- A family is demanding action from Volusia County
   Schools after a district mental health counselor pressed charges
   against a [23]10-year-old student whom [24]she accused of groping her.

   The incident has made national headlines -- and even provided material
   to [25]Saturday Night Live -- but the family says the boy did not grab
   the employee's breast during a hug like she reported to the Holly Hill
   Police Department. They have hired an attorney to defend the boy, who
   served a 10-day suspension from school and is still facing simple
   battery charges.

   In addition to clearing the boy's record, the family is demanding the
   school district fire the employee and discipline others involved.

   "We will not stand by this and allow him to be accused of something
   that he did not do," Ed Hollins, the boy's grandfather, said at a
   virtual press conference Monday morning. "I would not stand for my
   grandchild or any child to be treated this way by a professional. This
   is a new way of lynching."

   `He's only 10': [26]Florida school employee presses charges against
   student after she says she was groped

   The family, along with attorney Rawsi Williams and [27]West Volusia
   NAACP President Sean King, said the boy is among the latest of many
   Black students who have been disproportionately and more severely
   punished by the Volusia County school system.

   "Over the last two years of being president, this is a weekly call that
   I'm getting with situations of this nature, especially with the Volusia
   County school system, where our Black and brown kids are put on the
   wrong end of every situation, and no matter how you confront the issue,
   it continues to happen," King said, calling the incident a "travesty."

   The News-Journal, a part of the USA TODAY Network, does not name or
   publish photos of juveniles accused of crimes. It is also not naming
   the district employee, who has opted into [28]Marsy's Law to protect
   her privacy.

Employee accused boy of groping her

   The district mental health counselor reported the alleged incident Oct.
   24.

   A suspension letter sent to the boy's guardians stated the counselor
   was in the student's classroom discussing another student when the
   class returned from lunch and the child "approached (the counselor) to
   hug her."

   "(The counselor) turned sideways to give a side hug," the report
   stated. "(The student) put his left arm around her shoulder and then
   with his right hand he reached and grabbed her left breast in which she
   had to grab his wrist and remove his hand."

   The explanation states that the student "proceeded to smirk and walk
   away" and later "began yelling and kicking things and stormed off" when
   his primary teacher called him to ask about the incident.

   The Holly Hill Police Department report, which the employee
   subsequently filed, stated that the incident, which was reported as a
   simple battery, happened around 11:30 a.m. to noon.

   That report states that the counselor saw the student running toward
   her and turned her body. The student hugged her and then "cupped her
   left breast in a disrespectful way," and she had to "forcibly remove
   his hand," she told police.

   The report also notes that the primary teacher in the classroom did not
   witness the incident, but tried to talk to the student about it
   afterward.

   'Inability to reform behavior': [29]Decades of abuse uncovered but
   unpunished at exclusive California private school

Black students disproportionately disciplined, attorney says

   The family disputes the counselor's version of the incident and notes
   there were no witnesses. They also object to the school district's
   handling of the "wrongful suspension."

   "That really hit me really hard that a mental health specialist could
   accuse my grandson of (that), and then the wording that she used, it
   was so graphic, like he's some kind of sex maniac or something. It's
   like, this really hurts," the boy's grandmother, Lakesha Hollins, said
   after wiping away tears with a tissue.

   The family's pastor, Cynthia Williams, said the boy is loving, kind,
   honest and well-mannered.

   The child's father, whom The News-Journal is not naming to protect the
   boy's identity, said he was at a loss for words when the boy asked if
   people would look at him as a "monster" rather than as himself when he
   returns to school.

   The family is awaiting a meeting to allow the boy to return to school
   and has requested he be put in a different classroom and have no
   contact with the counselor. The district considered whether to expel
   the 10-year-old but did not find enough evidence to do so.

   "Time and time again, we have seen Volusia County Schools violate the
   rights of their Black students," Williams, the family's Miami-based
   attorney, said.

   Williams has previously defended [30]two Black students who accused
   district employees of putting them in chokeholds in two separate
   incidents.

   She said calls that she gets from minority families are often related
   to suspension or extreme discipline, such as choking or "unwarranted
   and excessive physical contact." Non-minority families more often reach
   out to her about bullying and less severe incidents.

Family wants record cleared, charges dropped and apology

   In this situation, Williams is asking the school district to reverse
   the boy's suspension; expunge the incident from his record; apologize
   to the family; terminate the mental health counselor; and discipline
   the school's principal and the other teacher in the room, whom they say
   yelled at the boy and wrongfully accused him, even though she did not
   witness it.

   Williams says they have already contacted the Florida Department of
   Education to file complaints against the licenses and certifications of
   the counselor, teacher and principal. They also plan to file complaints
   against Volusia County Schools with the U.S. Department of Education
   for the "well-known and pervasive pattern" of racialdiscrimination
   within the district.

   She said the district failed to follow its own policy for investigation
   and discipline, as it did not comply with the family's request to meet
   with the school and did not notify the family of a meeting to uphold
   the suspension.

   Massive outcry: [31]Family of a Black Utah fifth grader who died by
   suicide to sue for school's response to bullying

   Williams also noted the suspension notice was not signed by the school
   and left several boxes blank regarding whether the child had been given
   a chance to present his version or deny the charges, as well as whether
   the parent was called.

   VCS Director of Communications Angel Gomez previously shared via email
   that a District Student Placement Committee determines whether to
   recommend students for expulsion. He said the committee meets privately
   and no one else is allowed at the meetings, but parents and guardians
   could appeal a decision afterward.

   "The student has been disciplined to the extent of the student code of
   conduct. Under Florida law, teachers remain private citizens and school
   districts cannot encourage nor prohibit the exercise of criminal
   charges or prosecutions by employees," Gomez wrote on Monday. "Volusia
   County Schools is not able to make any comments regarding any
   disciplinary action on a student or any action taken by a staff member
   involving student discipline."

   Even if he did accidentally touch the counselor, Williams says the
   discipline was not "restorative and logical," as a [32]document on the
   district's discipline procedures states. That phrasing, which appears
   in a 2020 introduction to the student conduct code, says discipline
   should make "sense to everyone involved," and that "teaching students
   to really think about how their behavior affects others" is key.

   "Reasonable adults would have said, `This was an accident,' and moved
   on," she said.

   On a second stage, Williams is prepared to fight the pending charge
   filed with the Holly Hill Police Department if it moves forward.

   She said the police department has instructed that the charge would be
   dropped if the student attended a program for the alleged deviancy,
   which they are opposing on the grounds that the boy did nothing wrong.

   A third course may be to demand damages from the school district
   through a federal lawsuit for violating the boy's rights, which could
   unfold further down the road.

Psychology undergraduate aims to better understand the role of discrimination
in sleep

Crystal Li conducts research on minority populations and the transition to
college
     __________________________________________________________________

   December 19, 2022

   Crystal Li, an Arizona State University undergraduate psychology major
   with a minor in Spanish, hopes to make a difference in diverse
   communities through graduate research.

   When she was in high school, she volunteered in an underserved
   community in the San Francisco Bay Area that had just been hit with a
   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid for undocumented
   immigrants. Her internship gave her firsthand experience with the
   impact that research and interventions can have on the youth in the
   community. She conducted research with the students, and from that
   point on, she knew that she wanted to pursue psychology research.

   "The first lab that I joined was the [32]Adolescent Stress and Emotion
   Lab with Professor [33]Leah Doane. I've been in that lab for almost two
   years now, and the other lab that I'm a part of is the [34]Arizona Twin
   Project with professors [35]Mary Davis and [36]Kathryn
   Lemery-Chalfant," Li said. "Coming into college, I really didn't know
   what specifically my research interests were, but all I knew was that I
   really wanted to prioritize working in a lab that worked with diverse
   populations."

   The Adolescent Stress and Emotion Lab conducts research on child and
   adolescent well-being using physiological, psychological and contextual
   factors with a particular focus on stress.

   "We focus on understanding daily experiences, physiology and sleep in
   the prediction of health and academic trajectories, as well as how
   transactions between culture and neurobiological systems may influence
   these pathways across development," Doane said.

   While conducting research in the lab, Li was mentored by graduate
   student Jeri Sasser, a graduate mentor in the ASU [37]ENERGIZE project,
   which guides underrepresented students in psychology and neuroscience
   to streamline the process of conducting research to prepare for
   graduate school. This mentorship encouraged Li to also give back as an
   undergraduate mentor in the program.

   "I'm currently an ENERGIZE peer mentor. This means that I mentor
   students about labs and connect them to resources, as well as check in
   and see how everything's going. I think that's really a nice little
   thing to do because Jeri was that person for me when I joined the
   Adolescent Stress and Emotion Lab. Mentorship is so important to
   inspire students to continue pursuing research and to believe that they
   have a place in research," Li said.

   Li is currently applying to doctoral programs for developmental
   psychology. Her future research interests are in studying culture,
   sleep and stress, and academics and their role in development among
   ethnic, racial and minority youth.

   This fall, Li also defended her honors thesis as part of the psychology
   honors seminar on the relationship between ethnic racialdiscrimination
   and both objective and subjective measures of sleep among Latino
   students in their transition to college.

   "I presented to my classmates as well as my thesis committee, which was
   Dr. Doane, Dr. Jinni Su, Dr. Thao Ha and Jeri Sasser," Li said. "It was
   such a wonderful experience, but I'm so glad it is over now! I spent
   over a year and a half on the project, and to see it through to
   completion was extremely validating."

   Li's advice to other students who are scared of pursuing research? Just
   go for it.

   "I was very scared to join a lab because I had no idea what to expect
   and I didn't know if I was well-suited for that kind of environment.
   Research can be really daunting for students - that's why I really
   appreciate what ENERGIZE is doing, and I wish I'd known about it when I
   was initially applying to labs," Li said.

   "Something that I'm really interested in looking at is continuing my
   investigation of my honors thesis on discrimination in sleep and
   further exploring protective factors that can help protect you from
   harmful effects of discrimination," Li said. "Transitioning into higher
   education is difficult for many people, and when you add in any kind of
   race-based stressor, that can be a huge barrier."

   The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication fall
   2022 convocation ceremony celebrated the accomplishments of almost 340
   graduates while also serving as a homecoming for one of its most
   supportive and successful alumni.

   Christine Devine, an Arizona State University trustee and Cronkite
   Alumni Hall of Fame inductee, delivered the keynote address at the
   ceremony held on Wednesday, Dec. 14, at Desert Financial Arena in
   Tempe. Students wearing maroon and gold caps and gowns, smiling widley

   Devine is an award-winning television news anchor with Fox 11 Los
   Angeles, where she has worked for more than 30 years, and an active
   Cronkite School alumna who generously supports the school and ASU. In
   2007, she endowed the Christine Devine Scholarship, which provides
   scholarship support each year to students in the Cronkite School.

   In her convocation speech, Devine reflected on her journey that started
   as a Cronkite student in the 1980s and took her through a couple of
   small and medium media markets before landing in Los Angeles in 1990.

   Devine, who grew up in Tolleson, Arizona, the Phoenix area's West
   Valley, began her broadcasting career working as a reporter in San
   Angelo, Texas. She credited former ASU journalism professor Ben Silver
   with helping her find the job after he posted her resume on a board at
   a news directors conference.

   "I'd go to McDonald's and I would order a cheeseburger and water. I had
   no money," she said. "But that job would lead me to say we don't do
   this for the money. We do it for the passion of wanting to be a part of
   the ever-changing world. To not sit on the sidelines, but to be in the
   game."

   Devine emphasized that life was about to change for the graduates as
   they were about to enter their careers, but she encouraged them to
   learn from their mistakes and celebrate their successes.

   "So there will be fewer football games, Friday night parties, the
   camaraderie you all have here. It is all the real world, to which I say
   -- give life a shot," she said.

   She told the graduates to "find your passion, your place to contribute,
   your place to shine."

   Devine also encouraged students to stay in touch with ASU and the
   Cronkite School by joining the alumni association, visiting campus and
   connecting with fellow Sun Devils if they move to a new city.

   Her decision to give back to ASU was influenced by a mentor she met
   when she moved to Los Angeles, who she credits with helping her develop
   as a young woman and professional at the time.

   "You don't need to touch the masses, but please work to touch just one
   life, just one person," she said.

   In total, 337 students received degrees, including 80 with a Bachelor
   of Arts in mass communication and media studies, 53 with a Bachelor of
   Arts in journalism and mass communication, 61 with a Bachelor of
   Science in digital audiences, 30 Bachelor of Arts in sports journalism
   and one with a Bachelor of Arts in digital media literacy.

   The Cronkite School also awarded 111 master's degrees. That includes 58
   with a Master of Science in digital audience strategy, 16 with a Master
   of Mass Communication, 21 with a Master of Arts in sports journalism,
   15 with a Master of Arts in investigative journalism and one with a
   Master of Science in business journalism. One student received a PhD in
   Journalism and Mass Communication.

   Student speaker Raven Payne referred to her fellow classmates as
   resilient for having endured a global pandemic during their time at the
   Cronkite School, which forced them to adjust the way they learned,
   worked on projects and reported their stories.

   Payne implored her classmates to follow their own paths, create their
   opportunities and not to settle.

   "Times are changing, and if they don't change fast enough, we will
   change them ourselves," she said. "We have the pen, paper and will to
   be the authors of our own stories."
