../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   United States, most U.S. adults say the legacy of slavery continues to
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   have an impact on the position of black people in American society
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   today. More than four-in-ten say the country hasn't made enough
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   progress toward racial equality, and there is some skepticism,
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   particularly among blacks, that black people will ever have equal
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   rights with whites, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
--
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   In addition, roughly two-thirds say it's become more common for people
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   to express racist views since Trump became president.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   Blacks are particularly gloomy about the country's racial progress.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   More than eight-in-ten black adults say the legacy of slavery affects
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   the position of black people in America today, including 59% who say it
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   affects it a great deal. About eight-in-ten blacks (78%) say the
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   country hasn't gone far enough when it comes to giving black people
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   equal rights with whites, and fully half say it's unlikely that the
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   country will eventually achieve racial equality.

../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   The nationally representative survey of 6,637 adults was conducted
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   online Jan. 22-Feb. 5, 2019, in English and Spanish, using Pew Research
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Center's [96]American Trends Panel.^[97]1 In addition to exploring the
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   public's views about the state of race relations and racial inequality
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   in America, the survey also looks at personal experiences with racial
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   and ethnic discrimination and the role race plays in people's lives.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Among the report's key findings:
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-Most Americans say it's now more common for people to express racist or
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:racially insensitive views; more than four-in-ten say it's more acceptable
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   [98]Most say it's now more common for people to express racist or
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   racially insensitive views
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   Most Americans (65%) - including majorities across racial and ethnic
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   groups - say it has become more common for people to express racist or
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   racially insensitive views since Trump was elected president. A smaller
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   but substantial share (45%) say this has become more acceptable.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Democrats and those who lean Democratic are more likely than
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Republicans and Republican leaners to say it has become more common and
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   more acceptable for people to express racist and racially insensitive
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   views since Trump was elected president. Among Democrats, 84% say this
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   is now more common and 64% say it's more acceptable; fewer than half of
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Republicans say it has become more common (42%) and just 22% say it has

../dumps-text/en-3.txt-Republicans and Democrats have vastly different views on race
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   [102]White Republicans, white Democrats differ widely in their views of
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   the country's racial progress
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   In addition to being linked to views of Trump's handling of race
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   relations, partisanship is strongly associated with racial attitudes
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   more broadly. In fact, after controlling for other factors,
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   partisanship has a greater association with views about the country's
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   racial progress than demographic factors, though being young and more
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   educated are also significant predictors, particularly among
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   whites.^[103]3
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Because whites and nonwhites often have widely different views of
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   racial issues, and nonwhites disproportionately identify with or lean
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   to the Democratic Party, gaps between Republicans and Democrats are
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   often shown among whites in this report in order to account for
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   differences in the racial composition of the two parties.^[104]4
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   White Democrats (64%) are far more likely than white Republicans (15%)
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   to say the country hasn't gone far enough when it comes to giving black
--
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Eight-in-ten white Democrats - vs. 40% of white Republicans - say the
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   legacy of slavery continues to have an impact on black people's
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   position in American society today. And when it comes to views about
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   racial discrimination, 78% of white Democrats say the bigger problem is
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   people not seeing it where it really does exist, while a similar share
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   of white Republicans say people seeing racial discrimination where it
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   really does not exist is the bigger problem.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-Blacks are more likely than other groups to say their race has had a negative
--
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   to get ahead at least a little, with 18% saying it has hurt a lot.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   About a quarter of Hispanics and Asians (24% each) and just 5% of
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   whites say their race or ethnicity has had a negative impact. In turn,
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   whites are more likely than other groups to say their racial background
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   has helped them at least a little.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Among blacks, those with at least some college experience are more
--
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Education is also linked with whites' perceptions of the impact their
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   race has had on their ability to get ahead. Small shares of whites
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   across educational levels say their racial background has hurt their
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   ability to succeed, but those with a bachelor's degree are more likely
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   than those with less education to say being white helped them at least
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   a little.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   Across all racial and ethnic groups, more point to their own hard work
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   than to any other attribute, including their race, their gender, the
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   people they know or their family's financial situation, as something
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   that helped them get ahead.
--
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   same.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Among those who say being black hurts a person's ability to get ahead,
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   blacks are far more likely than whites to point to racial
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   discrimination, less access to high-paying jobs and less access to good
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   schools as major reasons why this is the case. In turn, whites are more
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   likely than blacks to point to family instability and lack of good role
--
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   groups (22%) say a lack of motivation to work hard is to blame.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   There are wide partisan gaps in these views. Most white Democrats who
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   say being black hurts a person's ability to succeed point to racial
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   discrimination (70%) and less access to good schools (75%) or
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   high-paying jobs (64%) as major reasons for this (among black
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Democrats, the shares are 86%, 74% and 78%, respectively). By

../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   feared for their safety.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Among blacks, those with darker skin tones are more likely to say they
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   have experienced racial discrimination generally, but skin color is not
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   necessarily associated with having faced specific situations because of
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   their race or ethnicity. In fact, for blacks, being male and having
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   higher levels of education are more consistently associated with the
--
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   country, compared with 78% of the U.S. Asian adult population overall).
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Despite this limitation, it is important to report the views of Asians
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   on race relations and racial inequality, as well as their personal
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   experiences with racial discrimination, as the U.S. Asian population is
../dumps-text/en-3.txt:   [114]growing faster than any other major racial or ethnic group.
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   Measuring the attitudes of Asians on these topics is an important piece
../dumps-text/en-3.txt-   in understanding the state of race in America today.
