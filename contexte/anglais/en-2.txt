../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   ineffective at curbing structural discrimination and racial inequality
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   because of judicial decisions that significantly undermined their scope

../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   contemporary racially discriminatory effects of structures of

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Article 2(1) of ICERD states that States Parties need to pursue the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   elimination of racial discrimination in all its forms. ICERD prohibits
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   discriminatory practices and requires that States Parties "take
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   effective measures to review governmental, national and local policies,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   and to amend, rescind or nullify any laws which have the effect of

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   justice";[57][36] and article 6 requires states to guarantee "effective
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   protection and remedies, through competent national tribunals," against
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   acts of racial discrimination.[58][37]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   The CERD has broadly articulated that "the mere fact of belonging to a
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   racial or ethnic group . . . is not a sufficient reason, de jure or de
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   facto, to place a person in pretrial detention"[59][38] and that States
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   should "ensure that the courts do not apply harsher punishments solely
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   because of an accused person's membership of a specific racial or
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   ethnic group."[60][39] Additionally, the UN, in its 2021 common
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   position on incarceration, stated that "incarceration should be used as
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   a last resort," and recommended shifting to non-custodial
--
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   colour, or national or ethnic origin," to equal treatment before all
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   organs administering justice.[64][42] In its most recent review, the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   Committee went further, expressing its concern that "members of racial
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, continue to be
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   disproportionately arrested, incarcerated and subjected to harsher
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   sentences, including life imprisonment without parole and the death
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   penalty."[65][43] It specifically recommended that the US amend "laws
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   and policies leading to racially disparate impacts in the criminal
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   justice system" at all levels of government and implement "effective
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   national strategies or plans of action aimed at eliminating structural
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   discrimination."[66][44] In its 2021 submission, the US reported that

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   that its own Department of Justice (DOJ) found the risk assessment
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   tool  the Prisoner Assessment Tool Targeting Estimated Risk and Needs
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   (PATTERN) created by DOJ in connection with the First Step Act,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   resulted in racial disparities.[73][50] Despite repeated attempts at
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   reform, the tool continues to overestimate the number of Black women
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   who will engage in recidivism, compared to white women, and produces
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   other racial disparities.[74][51]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   The [112]ICERD requires States to "pay the greatest attention possible

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   from the special regime to which they are entitled in relation to the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   execution of sentences."[113][70] Other prominent human rights bodies
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   have reinforced this message. The Committee on the Rights of the Child
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   (CRC) has stated that "particular attention must be paid to de facto
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   discrimination and [racial] disparities"[114][71] and urged states to

../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   institutions, national and local" eschew racial
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   discrimination,[124][81] the ICERD contains provisions that bear
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   specifically on homelessness and poverty. Article 5(e) of the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Convention addresses discrimination in protections against unemployment
--
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Additionally, Article 5(f) articulates a "right of access to any place
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   or service intended for use by the general public."[126][83] In 2014,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   the CERD expressed concern over the "high number of homeless persons,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   who are disproportionately from racial and ethnic minorities," and the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   "criminalization of homelessness through laws that prohibit activities
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   such as loitering, camping, begging and lying down in public
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   spaces."[127][84] The Committee recommended abolishing laws

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   through encampment clearances and property destruction by sanitation
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   workers and police.[136][93] In cities like Los Angeles as well as
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   elsewhere in the US, a long history of racial discrimination in
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   housing, lending, employment, policing, and other factors (government
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   policies like "urban renewal" and freeway construction included)  have
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   led to high levels of Black homelessness.[137][94]
--
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   actual guilt or innocence.[146][103] Additionally, pretrial
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   incarceration can result in even more fines and fees, as some jails
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   bill detained people for each day of their detention.[147][104] These
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   inequalities have troubling racial implications, as Black people are
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   2.5 times more likely than white people to live in poverty and face

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   regards petty street crime and offenses related to drugs" as an

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   discrimination against people who use drugs."[166][123] In its 2014
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   concluding observations to the US, the CERD expressed concern over "the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   application of mandatory minimum drug-offense sentencing policies" that
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   exacerbate racial disparities in the criminal legal system.[167][124]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Additionally, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   rights highlighted the "confused and counterproductive drug policies"
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   in the US in his 2018 country report. The report described how, in the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   context of drug addiction in the US, the "main responses have been
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   punitive," rather than the appropriate response of "increased funding
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   and improved access to vital care and support."[168][125] The report
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   further suggested that this "urge to punish" has "racial undertones,"
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   noting the disparities in sentencing between Black users of crack
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   cocaine and white users of opioids.[169][126] Similarly, the UN Working
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Group of Experts on People of African Descent has urged the US to amend
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   any judicial policies that disproportionately target Black people,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   stating that "the war on drugs has operated more effectively as a
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   system of racial control than as a mechanism for combating the use or
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   trafficking of narcotics."[170][127]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   In its 2021 report to the CERD, the US pointed to the 2018 enactment of
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   the First Step Act, a law that reduced racial disparities in sentences
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   for certain drug crimes.[171][128] While these reforms are helpful,

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   "discriminatory bans" on entry to the United States, which had been
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   implemented by former President Trump and rescinded by President Biden.
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Commentators have pointed to the way in which anti-Muslim animus long
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   operated as a form of racial discrimination in the US immigration
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   system, prior to these bans on entry.[245][202] While the current
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   administration rescinded the "discriminatory bans," the administration
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   has failed to adequately remedy past discriminatory exclusions

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   asylum-seekers from ever setting foot in the United States, US
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   immigration enforcement at the border and in the interior of the US has
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   a disparate impact on the basis of race. This is caused in part by the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   failure of US constitutional interpretation to prohibit racial
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   profiling in immigration enforcement and the continued reliance on
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   racial profiling in border and national security enforcement.[260][217]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   It is also the product of the intersection between structural
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   discrimination in the US criminal legal system and deportation law. One
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   recent study, reviewing over 13,000 stops by law enforcement officials
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   in the US State of Michigan, found clear evidence that CBP uses "racial
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   profiling to target immigrants from Latin America and other people of
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   color."[261][218] As Arnulfo Gomez described in relation to one such

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-       enforcement to eliminate the existing border and national security
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-       loopholes and prohibit discrimination based on actual or perceived
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-       race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, and English proficiency.
--
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   assignments, jails, and booking facilities.[284][238] As of March 2022,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Texas had deployed state troopers and mass-mobilized members of the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   National Guard, who made at least 208,000 arrests.[285][239] Affidavits
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   of arresting officers reveal that arrests are based on racial and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   national origin profiling, repeatedly describing those arrested as
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   "Hispanic" and "undocumented."[286][240] These criminal proceedings
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   have resulted in prolonged detention in egregious conditions; many

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-Racial Discrimination in Public Services and Social Protection
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Article 5 of ICERD provides that "States Parties undertake to prohibit
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   guarantee the right of everyone" to economic and social rights,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   including protection against unemployment, the right to medical care,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   social security, social services, and education, and just conditions of
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   work and equal pay for equal work. Article 2 of ICERD further requires
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   concrete state action to eliminate disparities in economic rights.
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   However, racial minorities in the United States continue to suffer a
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   lack of economic security compared to their white counterparts.
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   The median wealth of white households in the United States is
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   significantly higher than that of Black, Indigenous, or Latinx
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   households. This so-called racial wealth gap[290][243] has grown since
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   the country ratified ICERD, and the median wealth of white households
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   is now at least ten-times that of the median Black household.[291][244]

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   people of color.[296][249] Gaps in preparedness and response to the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Covid-19 pandemic have disproportionately negatively burdened people of
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   color,[297][250] which has deepened existing racial injustices in
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   health care,[298][251] housing,[299][252] employment,[300][253]

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-Public Health during the Covid-19 Pandemic
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Article 5 of ICERD provides that "States Parties undertake to prohibit
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms" in the right
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   to "public health" and "medical care"[307][260] and provide equal
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   access to healthcare services.[308][261] CERD has specifically mandated
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   that states address the disproportionate impact of the Covid-19
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   pandemic on racial minorities.[309][262] Where there are persistent
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   disparities, ICERD requires states to affirmatively adopt measures to
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   address them.
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   The Committee has expressed concern over the failure of the US to
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   address racial disparities in access to affordable health care, as many
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion program, excluding
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   substantial numbers of racial minorities. In addition, the Committee
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   expressed concern that many states have explicitly excluded migrants
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   from health care.[310][263] In 2014, it recommended that the US "take
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   concrete measures" to ensure individuals, "in particular racial and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   ethnic minorities who reside in states that have opted out of" the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Affordable Care Act (ACA) and migrants have "access to affordable and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   adequate health-care services."[311][264] CERD has recommended that the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   US eliminate steep racial disparities in sexual and reproductive
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   health, collect data, and improve monitoring and accountability
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   systems.[312][265] In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, CERD has
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   made clear that States are obligated to "ensure equal access" to
--
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   are disproportionately impacted both by diabetes and its negative
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   health outcomes, and are especially vulnerable to the harmful human
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   rights impact of insulin prices in the US.[315][268] The Covid-19
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   pandemic has deepened existing racial injustices in health
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   care[316][269]: minorities are more likely to suffer severe illness and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   die from Covid-19[317][270] and face barriers to vaccine
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   access.[318][271]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   Black people suffer from particularly acute racial disparities in
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   maternal mortality and cervical cancer rates.[319][272] The maternal
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   mortality rate for Black women is three times higher than white women
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   and rose further between 2019 and 2020, driven by significant increases
--
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   more than[333] 940 percent since January 2022, while ICE has only
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   administered booster shots to 671 of the 22,000 people in ICE
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   detention.[334][284] Given the rapid spread of the virus behind bars,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   and the racially disproportionate prison population, Black and Latinx
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   people have been particularly vulnerable.[335][285] By May 2020, Black
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   people accounted for 60% of Covid-19 deaths in the New York State
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   prison system, despite comprising 48% of detainees.[336][286]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:To eliminate racial disparities in public health, the US should:
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-     * Improve the affordability and availability of health insurance for
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-       low- and middle-income earners. In particular, consider legislation
--
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-     * Support community health workers and community-based approaches to
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-       reproductive health care that address healthcare access and the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-       social determinants of health.
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:     * Establish inclusivity policies that: support linguistic and racial
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-       diversity, including in federally qualified health clinics; and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-       acknowledge, confront, and seek to remedy historic and current
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:       experiences of racial discrimination in public health, including by
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-       creating an official, confidential, and accessible complaint
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-       mechanism for patients who use federally qualified health
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-       facilities.
--
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   ICERD requires states to guarantee the rights to social security and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   social services without distinction as to race,[337][287] and the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Committee has made clear that States are obligated to eliminate all
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   forms of racial inequities, whether intentional or not.[338][288]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Despite these protections, Black and Latinx people continue to face
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   underinvestment in social protection, which has contributed to profound
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   disparities in poverty and economic security. While, in the past,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   America's public benefits system helped reduce and prevent poverty and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   racial disparities by providing basic economic, food, childcare, and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   housing support, thereby preventing the intergenerational transmission
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   of poverty, it has weakened substantially over the past
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   decades.[339][289]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   The inadequate support system has been driven by racial
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   animus,[340][290] community violence,[341][291] and discriminatory
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   government policies based on racist stereotypes[342][292] as well as
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   federal delegation to states.[343][293] Although most safety net
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   programs are federally funded, state control over program design,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   rules, and benefit levels has resulted in inconsistent protection and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   racial inequalities. Similar to problematic aspects of the Medicaid
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   provision,[344][294] US regions with larger populations of color have
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   weaker safety nets and higher rates of economic hardship.[345][295] For
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   example, workers of color have higher unemployment rates and also are

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Although the US issued stimulus checks and other relief, these measures
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   could not repair the social safety net shredded by decades of budget
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   cuts and draconian rules.[352][302] In addition, there were racial
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   disparities in the provision of the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Economic Security (CARES) Act economic impact payments.[353][303]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Undocumented immigrants were also largely left without relief during

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   Discrimination and segregation in the education sector remain rampant
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   across the US, driving inequality in education and in life
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   opportunities.[361][311] Although the population is increasingly
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   diverse, racial segregation in US schools is higher now than it has
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   been in decades.[362][312] Majority-minority schools continue to be
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   underfunded and fail to provide adequate educational opportunities to
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   minority students.[363][313] US schools are primarily funded by

../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   policies built in part on racial discrimination, racial segregation,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   and the legacies of slavery has been widely recognized, including by

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   In its 2008 and 2014 concluding observations addressed to the US, the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   CERD expressed concern about racial segregation in public schools,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   finding that prohibition of the use of race-conscious measures as a
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   tool to promote integration inhibited progress.[367][317] The Committee
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   found that students from racial and ethnic minorities attend segregated
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   schools with unequal facilities, noting that even when students of
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   color attend racially diverse schools, they are often relegated to
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   "single race" classes, denied access to advanced courses, and unfairly
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   disciplined.[368][318]^The Committee recommended that the US undertake
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   a study to examine the reasons underlying de facto racial segregation,
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   and "adopt all appropriate measures" to reduce the achievement gap
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   between white and Black students "by improving the quality of education
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   provided to [Black] students."[369][319] In 2014, the Committee
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   [370]recommended that the US intensify its efforts to ensure equal
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   access to education by taking measures including developing a concrete
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   plan with goals and timelines to address racial segregation in schools
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   and neighborhoods, and increasing federal funding for programs
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   promoting racially integrated learning environments for
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   students.[371][320]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   In its 2021 report to the CERD, the US made a number of claims
--
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   education,[372][321] including 2021 American Rescue Plan's
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   funding[373][322] and other legislation,[374][323] as well as efforts
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   by the Justice Department Civil Rights Division[375][324] and the
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   Department of Education (DOE).[376][325] Nonetheless, the racial
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   disparities in educational opportunities among students resulting from
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   ongoing ICERD violations remain persistently and disturbingly high.
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   The CERD has recommended that measures be taken to reduce the school
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   dropout and suspension rates for children of African descent.[377][326]
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   In its 2008 concluding observations, the Committee highlighted racial
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   disparities in suspension and expulsion rates as exacerbating high

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   the justice system.[378][327] The Committee expressed particular

../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   national, racial, and ethnic groups. To combat prejudice and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   intolerance, the CERD has urged States to develop campaigns to educate

../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   history or racial discrimination in the US or about the history and
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   cultures of Black Americans and other people of color, and only a
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   handful of states mandate that such history be taught.[395][338] Even
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   where mandates exist, each US state may teach in a way that leads to

../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   self-esteem of Black students, it conveys historical realities to all
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   students and encourages empathy, understanding, and efforts to avoid
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   repeating the racist violence of the past.[398][341] Further, denying
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   the historical and contemporary realities of racial discrimination
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   impedes not only justice and accountability for historic wrongs, but
../dumps-text/en-2.txt:   the eradication of persisting structures of racial inequality that is
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-   the core purpose of ICERD.
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-
../dumps-text/en-2.txt-To address discrimination in the US education system, the US should:
