../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand the nuances
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   among Black people on issues of racial inequality and social change in
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   the United States. This in-depth survey explores differences among
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   Black Americans in their views on the social status of the Black
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   population in the U.S.; their assessments of racial inequality; their
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   visions for institutional and social change; and their outlook on the
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   chances that these improvements will be made. The analysis is the
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   latest in the Center's [93]series of in-depth surveys of public opinion

../dumps-text/en-30.txt-
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   The online survey of 3,912 Black U.S. adults was conducted Oct. 4-17,
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   2021. Black U.S. adults include those who are single-race, non-Hispanic
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   Black Americans; multiracial non-Hispanic Black Americans; and adults
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   who indicate they are Black and Hispanic. The survey includes 1,025
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   Black adults on Pew Research Center's [96]American Trends Panel (ATP)
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   and 2,887 Black adults on Ipsos' KnowledgePanel. Respondents on both

../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   identify as single-race Black and say they have no Hispanic background.
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   "Black Hispanic" respondents are those who identify as Black and say
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   they have Hispanic background. We use the terms "Black Hispanic" and
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   "Hispanic Black" interchangeably. "Multiracial" respondents are those
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   who indicate two or more racial backgrounds (one of which is Black) and
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   say they are not Hispanic.

../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   to address racial inequality
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   More than a year after the murder of George Floyd and the national
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   protests, debate and political promises that ensued, 65% of Black
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   Americans say the increased national attention on racial inequality has
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   not led to changes that improved their lives.^[102]1 And 44% say
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   equality for Black people in the United States is not likely to be
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   achieved, according to newly released findings from an October 2021

../dumps-text/en-30.txt-
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   This is somewhat of a reversal in views from September 2020, when half
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   of Black adults said the increased national focus on issues of race
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   would lead to major policy changes to address racial inequality in the
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   country and 56% expected changes that would make their lives better.
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   At the same time, many Black Americans are concerned about racial
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   discrimination and its impact. Roughly eight-in-ten say they have
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   personally experienced discrimination because of their race or
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   ethnicity (79%), and most also say discrimination is the main reason
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   many Black people cannot get ahead (68%).
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   Even so, Black Americans have a clear vision for how to achieve change
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   when it comes to racial inequality. This includes support for
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   significant reforms to or complete overhauls of several U.S.
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   institutions to ensure fair treatment, particularly the criminal
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   justice system; political engagement, primarily in the form of voting;
--
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   the quality of K-12 schools (40%).
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   Aside from their critiques of U.S. institutions, Black adults also feel
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   the impact of racial inequality personally. Most Black adults say they
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   occasionally or frequently experience unfair treatment because of their
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   race or ethnicity (79%), and two-thirds (68%) cite racial
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   discrimination as the main reason many Black people cannot get ahead
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   today.

../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   moving toward racial equality, while roughly three-in-ten (31%) say the

../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   Black Democrats and Democratic leaners to focus on the acts of
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   individuals. For example, when summarizing the nature of racism against

../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   Black Republicans (45%) are also more likely than Black Democrats (21%)
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   to say that Black people who cannot get ahead in the U.S. are mostly
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   responsible for their own condition. And while similar shares of Black
../dumps-text/en-30.txt:   Republicans (79%) and Democrats (80%) say they experience racial
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   discrimination on a regular basis, Republicans (64%) are more likely
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   than Democrats (36%) to say that most Black people who want to get
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   ahead can make it if they are willing to work hard.
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-
../dumps-text/en-30.txt-   On the other hand, Black Democrats are more likely than Black
