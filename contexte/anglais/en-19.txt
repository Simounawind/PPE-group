../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   In his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Boston
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   on 27 July 2004, before 9 million viewers, [88]Barack Obama presented
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   himself as the embodiment of racial reconciliation and American
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   exceptionalism. He had humble beginnings and a lofty ascent, and in him
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   both native and immigrant ancestry and African and European ancestry
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   came together. "I stand here knowing that my story is part of the
--
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   Dreams from My Father "quite extraordinary". Obama had written the
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   memoir in 1995 as he prepared to begin his political career in the
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   Illinois senate. In his most anti-racist passage, Obama reflected on
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   assimilated biracial blacks like "poor Joyce," his friend at Occidental
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   College in Los Angeles. In Joyce and other black students, he "kept
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   recognising pieces of myself", Obama wrote. People like Joyce spoke
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   about "the richness of their multicultural heritage, and it sounded
--
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   gravitational pull, the way integration always worked, a one-way
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   street. The minority assimilated into the dominant culture, not the
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   other way around. Only white culture could be `neutral' and
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   `objective'. Only white culture could be `nonracial' ... Only white
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   culture had `individuals'."
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   Obama's anti-racist litany continued in his critical revelation of the
--
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   Obama dismissed Jeremiah Wright's "profoundly distorted view", but
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   courageously refused to totally disown Wright. And then he opened his
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   general lecture on race, explaining that socioeconomic racial
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   inequities stemmed from the history of discrimination. From this firm
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   anti-racist opening, he pivoted to the consensus racist theory of the
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   "pervasive achievement gap", to the disproven racist theory of "the
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   erosion of black families" that "welfare policies ... may have
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   worsened", and to the unproven racist theory that racial discrimination
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   had bequeathed blacks a "legacy of defeat". According to Obama, this
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   "legacy of defeat" explained why "young men and, increasingly, young
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   women" were "standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons".

../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   condition."
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   It was a classic assimilationist retort: calling anti-racists "angry"
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   for truly believing in racial equality, for not seeing anything wrong
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   with black people, and for seeing everything wrong with discrimination.
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   Like civil rights activists [91]WEB Du Bois and [92]Martin Luther King
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   before him, Obama lumped these "angry" anti-racists in with angry,
--
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   defeat". Obama did not offer any childrearing or psychological lessons
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   for the presumably parentally and psychologically superior white
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   Americans. He merely asked them to join him on the "long march" against
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   racial discrimination - "not just with words but with deeds". He left
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   the Philadelphia platform on 18 March 2008, as he began, expressing the
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   half-truthful analogy of continuous racial progression. "This union may
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   never be perfect," he said, "but generation after generation has shown
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   that it can always be perfected."
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-
--
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   discrimination for a decade. It was working to put up something better:
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   a portrait of America conveying that there was no longer any need for
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   protective or affirmative civil rights laws and policies - and no
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   longer any need to ever talk about race. "Are we now in a post-racial
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   America? ... Is America past racism against black people?" John
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   McWhorter, professor at Columbia, asked in Forbes weeks after the
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   election. "I say the answer is yes."
--
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   and the historic opposition to him - should now know full well that the
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   more black people uplift themselves, the more they will find themselves
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   on the receiving end of a racist backlash. Uplift, as a strategy for
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   racial progress, has failed. Black individuals must stop worrying about
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   what other people may think about them. Individual blacks are not race
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   representatives. They are not responsible for those Americans who hold
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   racist ideas. Black people need to be their imperfect selves around
--
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   people human, make black people equal to all other imperfectly human
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   groups.
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   The other major strategy that racial reformers have used is educational
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   persuasion. As a strategy for racial progress, educational persuasion
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   has failed, because it has been predicated on the false construction of
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   the race problem: the idea that ignorance and hate lead to racist
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   ideas, which lead to racist policies. In fact, self-interest leads to
--
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   eradicated, are not eradicating, and will not eradicate racist ideas,
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   let alone racist policies. Power will never sacrifice self-interest,
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   cannot be educated away from its self-interest. Those who have the
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   power to abolish racial discrimination have not done so thus far, and
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   they will never do so as long as racism benefits them in some way.

../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   I am certainly not stating that there are no Americans in positions of
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   power who have ever tried to end racial disparities in their sphere of
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   influence. But these courageous anti-racist powerbrokers are more the
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   exception than the rule. As Americans have discarded old racist ideas,
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   new racist ideas have constantly been produced for their consumption.

../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   been a never-ending affair in America. That's why education will never
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   bring into being an anti-racist America.
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   To undermine racial discrimination, Americans must focus their efforts
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   on those who have the power to undermine racial discrimination. History
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   has shown that those Americans who have had the power to undermine
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   racial discrimination have rarely done so. They have done so, however,
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   when they realised that eliminating some form of racial discrimination
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   was in their interest, much as Abraham Lincoln chose to end slavery to
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   save the union. They have also conceded to anti-racist change as a
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   better alternative than the disruptive, disordered, politically harmful
--
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   demands are met.
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   But protesting against racist policies can never be a long-term
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   solution to eradicating racial discrimination in America. Just as one
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   generation of powerful Americans could decide or be pressured by
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   protest to end racial discrimination, when the conditions and interests
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   change, another generation could once again encourage racial
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   discrimination. That's why protesting against racist power has been a
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   never-ending affair in America.
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-
--
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   a time when Americans will realise that the only thing wrong with black
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   people is that they think something is wrong with black people. There
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   will come a time when racist ideas will no longer obstruct us from
../dumps-text/en-19.txt:   seeing the complete and utter abnormality of racial disparities.
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   There will come a time when we will love humanity, when we will gain
../dumps-text/en-19.txt-   the courage to fight for an equitable society for our beloved humanity,
