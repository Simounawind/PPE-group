../dumps-text/en-44.txt-   Chandra Jackson, a researcher and epidemiologist with the National
../dumps-text/en-44.txt-   Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, who has been studying
../dumps-text/en-44.txt:   racial and ethnic disparities in sleep.

../dumps-text/en-44.txt:   Yet the racial and ethnic disparities in sleep duration appear to be
../dumps-text/en-44.txt-   getting worse across the United States, according to recent research by

../dumps-text/en-44.txt:   racial discrimination - and jobs or working conditions," he said,
../dumps-text/en-44.txt-   adding that the convergence of all those factors may explain why
../dumps-text/en-44.txt-   getting the recommended amount of sleep "may be less common among Black
../dumps-text/en-44.txt-   adults than among White adults."
../dumps-text/en-44.txt-
../dumps-text/en-44.txt-   Caraballo-Cordovez and Jackson both emphasize that the causes behind
