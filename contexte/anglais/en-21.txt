../dumps-text/en-21.txt-
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   The Civil Rights Movement became a grassroots movement of black
../dumps-text/en-21.txt:   American citizens and white activists who supported them against racial
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   discrimination in the 1950s and 1960s. In the southern states,
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   centuries of slavery and decades of segregation have created a legal
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   and political system characterized by white supremacy. There were laws

../dumps-text/en-21.txt-
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   The African American legal strategy culminated in the US Supreme Court
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   in 1954, under the leadership of Earl Warren, which overturned many
../dumps-text/en-21.txt:   laws that allowed for racial segregation and discrimination. The
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   movement began when the US Supreme Court concedes that segregation is
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   wrong. ^3African Americans were re-entering politics in the South, and
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   young people across the country were inspired to take action. From 1964

../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   foundations increased. The emergence of the Black Power movement
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   challenged the established black leadership for its cooperation and
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   continued legalism and non-violence. Many popular ideas about the
../dumps-text/en-21.txt:   movement are linked to the racially discriminatory movement of Martin
../dumps-text/en-21.txt:   Luther King Jr., who was fighting racial inequality through nonviolent
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   resistance.

../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   segregation of African Americans. Another reason for the rise of the
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   movement can be called the economic superiority of the white population
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   over the blacks. The starting point was the stereotypes entrenched in
../dumps-text/en-21.txt:   society that made strong racial discrimination possible. People's
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   discontent grew, given that a significant part of the population did
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   not even have the right to vote, children could not study on an equal
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   basis with others, discrimination even touched places on buses.

../dumps-text/en-21.txt-One Race or Class Has Been More Powerful than the Other
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   Historically, the white race has always had economic and social
../dumps-text/en-21.txt:   superiority over the black race. However, racial and class superiority
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   did not stop African Americans from fighting for their rights and
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   making a difference. On the side of the oppressed population was the
../dumps-text/en-21.txt-   moral right to be considered equal to the other part of the population.
