   The pitfall of self-reported stress levels is that the baseline stress
   for some people is so high, a cancer diagnosis doesn't even register.

   Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who experience racial
   discrimination in the healthcare setting are more likely to have a
   greater level of pain, according to research published in the Journal
   of Pain. This level of pain, the authors argued, may be linked with
   depression and insomnia.

   Previous research has suggested that patients with SCD face inferior
   health care, such as longer wait-times, potentially because of adverse
   provider bias. In the United States, SCD is primarily diagnosed among
   Black patients and is considered by many -- incorrectly -- to be a
   race-related disease. Consequently, many patients with SCD in the US
   face racial discrimination and often, an insufficient access to
   high-quality care.

   Previous research has also suggested that discrimination may be linked
   with greater pain among patients with SCD, although how this manifests
   was previously unestablished. For this study, researchers evaluated
   factors that may link racial discrimination with an increased level of
   pain among patients with SCD.

   Overall, data from 68 patients with SCD were included. In the cohort,
   48 patients were female sex, the mean age was 38.69 years, and 53
   patients had attended some college. All patients provided baseline
   levels of pain and completed a pain diary over the subsequent 3-month
   period.

   Analysis showed that baseline depression and insomnia mediated a
   significant link between racial discrimination and baseline pain
   interference, average daily diary pain severity, and average daily
   diary pain interference. The authors suggested, furthermore, that
   discrimination is likely to contribute to depression, which leads to
   insomnia and a consequent increase in pain.

   "Findings support the need for systemic and structural changes to
   eliminate discrimination in healthcare settings and behavioral mood and
   sleep interventions to reduce the impact of discrimination on clinical
   pain," they wrote.
