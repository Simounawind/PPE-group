../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   A question that seems to be asked with increasing frequency is whether
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   Asian Americans are the beneficiaries of privileges historically
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   afforded to white people in the United States or if we are the victims
../dumps-text/en-37.txt:   of racial discrimination. But reality is much more complex. It's time
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   to discard this simplistic dichotomy.

../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   Take the [124]Students for Fair Admissions v[125]. Harvard case to be
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   heard in the US Supreme Court in October. Plaintiffs in the case argue
../dumps-text/en-37.txt:   that Asian Americans experience racial discrimination in Harvard
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   admissions, as evidenced, they claim, by admitted Asian American
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   students' higher GPAs and SAT scores compared to admitted students of
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   all other races, including white students. They also point to

../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   about Asian Americans' academic capability -- facilitate Asian American
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   kids' high levels of academic achievement. In this regard, Asian
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   Americans do indeed benefit from [136]"whiteness" as a system of
../dumps-text/en-37.txt:   advantage. In other words, the US education system has racially unequal
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   opportunities and hence outcomes baked into it, and Asian Americans
../dumps-text/en-37.txt:   have actually benefited from that racial inequality that historically
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   has privileged white students over Black and Latinx students.

../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   like these and [141]the choices many white Americans made (and continue
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   to make) about where to live were frequently related to a desire to
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   steer clear of Black people in particular. Many suburban properties
../dumps-text/en-37.txt:   even had explicit racially restrictive covenants, which barred the sale
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   of those properties to Black buyers. These covenants were legal until
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   the Fair Housing Act of 1968.

../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   Even today, Black middle-class professionals frequently do not choose
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   to live in towns like the one I studied, in part because [142]they
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   understand the problems likely to ensue if their children do not have
../dumps-text/en-37.txt:   peers who share their racial identity. [143]Racial steering by real

../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   Americans means we always benefit from the privileges of whiteness. The
../dumps-text/en-37.txt:   multifaceted nature of racial discrimination and privilege in the
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   United States is far more complex. To tackle it, we need to understand
../dumps-text/en-37.txt-   its diverse faces.
