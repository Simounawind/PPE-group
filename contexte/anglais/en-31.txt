../dumps-text/en-31.txt-Introduction and summary
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   America's legacy of segregation and racial discrimination--particularly
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   in the area of housing--has made communities of color more vulnerable
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   to the effects of climate change. People of color are more likely than
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   white people to reside in low-income neighborhoods, which have fewer
--
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   environmental hazards and natural disasters compared with affluent and
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   white communities.[82]^2
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   Racial inequalities in homeownership, the racial wealth gap, and racial
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   disparities in climate risks and exposure to environmental hazards
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   require a robust federal policy response to dismantle decadeslong
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   inequities and achieve a just and equitable society. Key to that
--
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   enterprises (GSEs)--which own or guarantee more than 60 percent of the
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   nation's home mortgages, including more than half of single-family home
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   mortgage loans.[83]^3 These two organizations are uniquely positioned
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   to reduce the nation's racial homeownership and wealth gaps while
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   promoting climate and environmental resilience in communities of
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   color.[84]^4
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   The GSEs--also known as the enterprises--can close racial housing and
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   wealth gaps and address environmental racism by including climate risk
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   and environmental justice considerations when designating areas that
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   are underserved by mortgage lending and by prioritizing the types of
--
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   climate resilience. Following the Biden administration's
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   recommendations, federal agencies throughout the entire policy spectrum
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   have begun to respond to the challenges of climate change, which are
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   deeply intertwined with racial inequities. Moreover, such inequalities
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   have a substantial geographic component. Therefore, when addressing
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   them, it is critical for policies to explicitly target underserved
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   communities of color to reverse the decadeslong patterns of
--
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   The United States is becoming increasingly diverse. Data from the 2020
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   census reveal that the country's population of color is rapidly
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   growing, whereas the white population is declining. As demographer
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   William H. Frey puts it, racial and ethnic diversity is taking
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   "different forms in different places."[88]^6 While Black people are
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   concentrated in the South and spill into several urban areas in the
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   North and parts of the West, the growing Hispanic population is largely
--
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   represent a growing threat to communities of color. The constant
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   overexposure of these communities to environmental hazards and risks
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   makes them even more vulnerable to climate-related natural disasters.
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   Because residential patterns vary greatly by racial and ethnic
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   group--and because some areas face elevated natural risks--some groups
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   face a greater exposure to natural risk than others.[119]^16 These
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   differences, which are quantified in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure
--
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   efforts particularly challenging.[128]^18 As Table 1 illustrates,
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   census tracts at very high risk of hydrometeorological natural
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   disasters such as hurricanes, coastal flooding, and riverine flooding
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   are overrepresented by nonwhite racial and ethnic groups. Only 16
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   percent of non-Hispanic white people reside in such areas, compared
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   with 18 percent of Black people, 19 percent of Hispanic people, and 21
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   percent of Native Americans. The geographic distribution of areas at
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   high risk of exposure--particularly to hydrometeorological natural
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   disasters--largely overlaps with the racial and ethnic distribution of
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   U.S. residents. (see Figure 1 and Figure 4) Areas along the Gulf of
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   Mexico and coastal Atlantic regions are especially vulnerable to
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   hurricanes and coastal flooding. Black and Hispanic populations
--
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   characteristics, limited greenspace, the density of buildings and
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   structures, and heat-retaining construction materials all combine with
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   increasing heat levels to produce what is known as the urban heat
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   island effect--particularly in racially segregated areas.[147]^30
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   According to data reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   Administration (NOAA), extreme heat waves represent the most serious
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   weather-related threats to human health.[148]^31 Evidence shows that in

../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   types of sources than white people.[164]^40 People of color are
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   estimated to have an air pollution index that is 15 points higher than
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   that of white people.[165]^41 Black people, in particular, are
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   disproportionately more exposed than other racial and ethnic groups to
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   large concentrations of ambient fine particulate air pollution
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   (particulate matter 2.5)--the largest environmental cause of
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   mortality.[166]^42
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   Usually, the disproportionate exposure of people of color to air
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   pollution and other pollutants is due to the close proximity of
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   racially segregated neighborhoods to highways, industrial plants, and
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   other sources of pollution.[167]^43 Areas with a high exposure to
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   environmental hazards and risks such as air pollution, lead paint, and
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   toxic facilities, among others, largely overlap with areas in which
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   different people of color are overrepresented. (see Figure 6) There
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   are, however, some geographic and racial variations in the exposure to
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   specific types of pollutants. For example, while proximity to toxic
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   sites is scattered throughout the U.S. territory and is particularly
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   high in urban areas, exposure to air pollutants and lead is remarkably
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   high in the Western part of the country, and exposure to respiratory
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   hazards and airborne toxic cancer risks is particularly elevated in the
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   Southeast region. Compared with non-Hispanic white people, virtually
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   all nonwhite racial and ethnic groups are overrepresented in such
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   areas. In particular, 41 percent of Black people, 50 percent of Asian
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   Americans and Pacific Islanders, and 47 percent of Hispanics reside in
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   very close proximity to traffic and toxic sites. Furthermore, more than
--
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   climate-related natural disasters pose to the GSEs and the implications
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   for communities of color, followed by a series of policy
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   recommendations. Specifically, the authors explore how the GSEs could
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   contribute to reducing the racial and ethnic homeownership gap while
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   simultaneously tackling the risks associated with climate change and
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   environmental injustice discussed above.
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-
--
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   To complement the initiatives outlined in the strategic plan, the FHFA
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   also directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to draft equitable plans with
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   the explicit goal of promoting equitable access to affordable and
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   sustainable housing by reducing the disparities in racial and ethnic
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   homeownership and reducing underinvestment or undervaluation in
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   formerly redlined areas.[208]^70
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   The equitable housing finance plans for 2022-2024 represent a step
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   forward in addressing racial inequalities in access to homeownership.
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   In their plans, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recognize the
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   disproportionate risks climate change poses to underserved communities
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   of color. However, similar to the strategic plan, the equitable housing

../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   The GSEs already have promising tools to better target underserved

../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   same time, address environmental injustice and the increasing climate
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   risk in these communities. Because of the geographic nature of racial
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   disparities in homeownership, the racial wealth gap, and the
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   disproportionate vulnerability that communities of color have to
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   environmental hazards and climate-related disasters, the FHFA should

../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   presence in geographically targeted areas, the affordable housing goals
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   have continued to be based predominantly on economic factors.
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   Furthermore, although the third goal explicitly addresses minority
../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   status, the goals have never distinguished among the racial and ethnic
../dumps-text/en-31.txt-   groups that make up minority neighborhoods.

../dumps-text/en-31.txt:   Decadeslong inequities in homeownership, the racial wealth gap, and
