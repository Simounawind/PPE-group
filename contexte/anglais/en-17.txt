../dumps-text/en-17.txt:   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_01
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-   Looking across 11 high-income countries, one in three older adults in
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-   the U.S. said they believe their health system treats people
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-   differently because of their race or ethnicity, nearly double the rate
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-   of older adults in Canada (17%).

../dumps-text/en-17.txt:   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_02
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-   In the United States, Black women and men are the most likely of any
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-   group to believe the health care system very often or often treats
../dumps-text/en-17.txt:   people differently because of their race or ethnicity. Across racial
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-   and ethnic groups, more women than men hold this view.

../dumps-text/en-17.txt-
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-   When asked whether they have ever been treated unfairly or felt that
../dumps-text/en-17.txt:   their health concerns were not taken seriously because of their racial
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-   or ethnic background, one in four Black and Latinx/Hispanic older
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-   adults in the U.S. said they have experienced this type of
../dumps-text/en-17.txt-   discrimination, approximately eight times the rate for older white
../dumps-text/en-17.txt:   adults. There were not significant differences by gender between racial
