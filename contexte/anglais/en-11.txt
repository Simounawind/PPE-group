   LDF issues a quarterly report entitled Death Row USA that contains
   death row populations by state and other statistics pertaining to
   capital punishment. For decades, LDF has been a pioneering voice in the
   fight to abolish capital punishment and eliminate racial discrimination
   from the court system. In our landmark 1972 case, Furman v. Georgia,
   LDF won the country's first and only nationwide halt to executions when
   the Supreme Court struck down capital punishment.
