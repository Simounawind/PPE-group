../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   police consider Black people suspects when [85]sitting in their
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   backyards, [86]failing to signal, and simply going about many daily
../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   life activities -- and that this racial targeting too often results in
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   callous abuses, unjust imprisonment, and senseless killings at law
../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   enforcement's hands. Tragically, policing is only one of many racial
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   discrimination pitfalls in America's criminal justice system, merely

../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   As the oldest civil rights legal organization in the United States, the
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   Legal Defense Fund (LDF) is intimately familiar with this system's
../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   failures. It cannot be overlooked how -- in addition to vast racial
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   disparities in policing, arrests, and detention -- every stage of the
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   criminal justice process following the filing of charges also

../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   [92]condemning interracial relationships, a bias that could've

../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   In 2021, LDF filed a [93]cert petition urging the Supreme Court to
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   review Thomas' conviction and jury discrimination claim. LDF's petition
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   detailed the Supreme Court's precedent protecting against such biases
../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   in courtroom proceedings. It also emphasized that racial biases within
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   the deliberation room cannot be tolerated because they undermine our
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   nation's promise for fair trials by an impartial jury. The Supreme
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   Court has yet to make a decision on whether it will consider Thomas'
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   case.
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-
../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   "The Supreme Court has long recognized that overt racial bias has no
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   place in our criminal justice system," says LDF Assistant Counsel
../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   Santino Coleman. "When jurors in a criminal case openly express racial
../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   bias, it creates the unacceptable risk that racial prejudice will
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   infect the jury's deliberative process. This risk is uniquely harmful
../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   in capital cases where jurors' racial biases may prevent them from
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   fairly considering mitigating evidence at sentencing. This not only
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   violates an accused person's constitutional right to trial by an
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   impartial jury, but erodes the legitimacy of the criminal justice
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   system."

../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   Still, further reform is critical. The [99]risk-assessment tool created

../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   for release, for example, has been shown to produce [100]racially

../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   provisions can be applied retroactively to those currently

../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   One of LDF's most high profile death penalty cases in recent memory,
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   Buck v. Davis challenged the death sentence of Texas death row inmate
../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   Duane Buck, whose death sentence was a blatant product of racial
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   discrimination. Mr. Buck's own attorney introduced testimony in the
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   sentencing phase of his trial that he was more likely to be dangerous
../dumps-text/en-11.txt-   solely because he is Black. LDF argued before the Supreme Court that
../dumps-text/en-11.txt:   the rule of law demands a new sentencing hearing free from racial bias.
