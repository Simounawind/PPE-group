../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   protecting freedmen and restructuring political relations in the South.
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   Many Republicans were keen to grant voting rights for freedmen in order
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   to build a new powerful voting bloc. Some Republicans, like U.S.
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   congressman Thaddeus Stevens, believed in racial equality, but the
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   majority were motivated primarily by the interest of their political
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   party. The only way to protect Republican interests in the South was to
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   give the vote to the hundreds of thousands of Black men. Republicans in

../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   Reconstruction brought the first moment of mass democratic
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   participation for African Americans. In 1860, only five states in the
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   North allowed African Americans to vote on equal terms with whites. Yet
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   after 1867, when Congress ordered southern states to eliminate racial
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   discrimination in voting, African Americans began to win elections
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   across the South. In a short time, the South was transformed from an
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   all-white, pro-slavery, Democratic stronghold to a collection of

../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   was extinguished when Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner's proposed
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   land reform bills were tabled in Congress. Radicalism had its limits,
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   and the Republican Party's commitment to economic stability eclipsed
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   their interest in racial justice.
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   Another aspect of the pursuit of freedom was the reconstitution of
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   families. Many freedpeople immediately left plantations in search of

../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   Frances Harper, for example, a freeborn Black woman living in Ohio,
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   urged them to consider their own privilege as white and middle class.
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   Universal suffrage, she argued, would not so clearly address the
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   complex difficulties posed by racial, economic, and gender
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   inequality.^[68]24

../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   The Civil War showed white women, especially upper-class women, life
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   without their husbands' protection. Many did not like what they saw,
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   especially given the possibility of racial equality. Formerly wealthy
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   women hoped to maintain their social status by rebuilding the prewar
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   social hierarchy. Through Ladies' Memorial Associations and other civic
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   groups, southern women led the efforts to bury and memorialize the

../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   opposite occurred for Black families. Since the entire South suffered
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   from economic devastation, many families were impoverished and sank
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   into debt. All southern women faced economic devastation, lasting
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   wartime trauma, and enduring racial tensions.

../dumps-text/en-50.txt-                    V. Racial Violence in Reconstruction
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   Violence shattered the dream of biracial democracy. Still steeped in
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   the violence of slavery, white southerners could scarcely imagine Black
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   free labor. Congressional investigator Carl Schurz reported that in the
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   summer of 1865, southerners shared a near unanimous sentiment that "You
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   cannot make the negro work, without physical compulsion."^[78]30
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   Violence had been used in the antebellum period to enforce slave labor
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   and to define racial difference. In the post-emancipation period it was
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   used to stifle Black advancement and return to the old order.
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   Much of life in the antebellum South had been premised on slavery. The
--
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   adoption by the U.S. Congress of the Thirteenth Amendment destroyed the
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   institution of American slavery and threw southern society into
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   disarray. The foundation of southern society had been shaken, but
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   southern whites used Black Codes and racial terrorism to reassert
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   control over formerly enslaved people.

../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   Cities became centers of Republican control. But white conservatives
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   chafed at the influx of Black residents and the establishment of
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   biracial politics. In nearly every conflict, white conservatives
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   initiated violence in reaction to Republican rallies or conventions or
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   elections in which Black men were to vote. The death tolls of these
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   conflicts remain incalculable, and victims were overwhelmingly Black.
--
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   The political and social consequences of the violence were as lasting
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   as the physical and mental trauma suffered by victims and witnesses.
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   Terrorism worked to end federal involvement in Reconstruction and
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   helped to usher in a new era of racial repression.
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   African Americans actively sought ways to shed the vestiges of slavery.
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   Many discarded the names their former enslavers had chosen for them and
--
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   identities as free citizens. Others resettled far from their former
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   plantations, hoping to eventually farm their own land or run their own
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   businesses. By the end of Reconstruction, the desire for
../dumps-text/en-50.txt:   self-definition, economic independence, and racial pride coalesced in
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   the founding of dozens of Black towns across the South. Perhaps the
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   most well-known of these towns was Mound Bayou, Mississippi, a Delta
../dumps-text/en-50.txt-   town established in 1887 by Isaiah Montgomery and Ben Green, formerly
