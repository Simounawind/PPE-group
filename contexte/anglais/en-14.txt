../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   In this study, we examined the county-level association between
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   racial/ethnic composition (the proportion of residents belonging to a
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   given racial/ethnic group) and CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   across the conterminous US using geospatial models. Our objectives were
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   to (a) evaluate the county-level distribution and spatial
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   autocorrelation of CWS arsenic and uranium, (b) assess the nationwide
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   county-level association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   arsenic and uranium concentrations in geospatial models, and c)
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   quantify the strength, direction, and spatial stationarity of these
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   associations at the local level. We specifically assessed geometric

../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   groups)^[99]20,[100]23,[101]28,[102]29. We also anticipated that the
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS arsenic and
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   uranium concentrations would be unique for each racial/ethnic group and
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   would differ in magnitude and direction of the association across
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   different regions of the US because of regional differences in
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   racial/ethnic composition, geologic context, urban vs rural landscapes,
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   and land-use patterns relevant for drinking water arsenic and uranium
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   concentrations. As a secondary analysis, we also assessed the
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS selenium and
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   barium because these metals/metalloids are also regulated in CWSs by
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   the EPA, are frequently detected in CWSs, and previous studies found
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   significant inequalities in concentrations across sociodemographic and

../dumps-text/en-14.txt-Discussion
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   Our study provides new evidence that racial/ethnic composition is
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   associated with public drinking water arsenic and uranium
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   concentrations, adding to a growing body of literature characterizing
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   nationwide environmental and racial injustices in US public drinking
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   water
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   contaminants^[145]16,[146]17,[147]18,[148]19,[149]20,[150]26,[151]27,[1
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   52]28,[153]29. Although our analysis was informed by a strong
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   drinking water exposures result from structural and environmental
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   racism^[155]20,[156]21,[157]22,[158]23,[159]24, our study is
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   descriptive in nature and is not intended to identify mechanisms by
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   which racial/ethnic public water concentration disparities were created
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   or reinforced.
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   As predicted, nationwide analyses indicated that a higher proportion of
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   Indian/Alaskan Native residents was associated with higher CWS arsenic
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   and uranium. These findings remained robust across several sensitivity
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   analyses considering alternative adjustment approaches and alternative
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   magnitudes of change in racial/ethnic composition, and are also
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   consistent with previous studies utilizing non-geospatial approaches at
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   the water system level^[160]20,[161]26,[162]29. These findings likely
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   reflect structural environmental racism and white supremacy and
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   privilege.
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   Structural racism refers to the "totality of ways in which societies
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   foster racial discrimination, through mutually reinforcing inequitable
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   systems (in housing, education, employment, earnings, benefits, credit,
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   media, health care, criminal justice, and so on)"^[163]36,[164]37.
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   Structural racism serves to maintain white supremacy, in part, by
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   detriment of communities of color^[165]38,[166]39,[167]40. Extensive
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   research in the fields of sociology and epidemiology support that
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   racism is a fundamental cause of disease and producer of health
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   inequalities across racial/ethnic groups^[168]41,[169]42,[170]43.
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   Structural racism produces health inequalities for marginalized
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   communities through numerous mechanisms, including through the creation
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   and perpetuation of inequalities in toxic environmental exposures,
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   higher proportion of non-Hispanic Black residents was associated with
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   higher CWS arsenic and uranium in the southwest, but not in the
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   southeast where arsenic and uranium water concentrations are low
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   (Fig. [198]1). These findings suggest that racial/ethnic inequalities
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   in public water contaminant exposures may be more likely or more severe
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   in geographic regions with both a high percentage of public water users
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   of the specified racial/ethnic group and relatively high concentrations
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   of specific contaminants in source water. Additional public water
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   contaminants beyond metals should be also assessed, as these will

../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   non-Hispanic White residents. Therefore, it is possible that the
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   current analysis may underestimate the impact of community
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   racial/ethnic composition on public water arsenic and uranium for both
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   non-Hispanic Black and American Indian communities in these particular
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   areas.
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   estimates described in the current study are small to modest, their
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   public health implications may be substantial when considered across
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   the entire population. Several studies have identified disparities in
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   health outcomes across racial/ethnic groups that are related to uranium
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   and arsenic exposure. For example, American Indian/Alaskan Native
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   populations experience substantially higher rates of kidney cancer
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   compared to non-Hispanic White populations, especially in the
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   2.67-2.8 times higher compared to the general US population^[227]69.
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   Our study has several limitations. First, our nationwide evaluation of
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   the county-level association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   metal concentrations may mask associations operating at finer
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   geographic resolutions (e.g. within states, or across Census blocks or
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   zip-codes)^[228]21,[229]70. We were not able to evaluate these
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   Second, although our nationwide, county-level analysis was intended to
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   minimize selection bias, we restricted our analyses to counties with at
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   least 100 residents in the racial/ethnic group of interest to avoid
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   positivity violations, and this may have introduced selection bias.
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   Counties excluded from analysis under this criterion had smaller
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   population sizes, lower population densities, a higher percentage of
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   associations at finer geographic resolutions, restricted to areas with
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   larger populations of interest. We relied on Census bridged race
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   categorized data, which does not capture several domains of
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   racial/ethnic composition and could lead to misclassification. In
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   addition, our analyses for uranium were limited by the relatively poor
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   spatial coverage in CWS uranium concentration estimates, especially for
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   the eastern and southeastern US. The CWS uranium concentrations used
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   records for the Fourth Six Year Review (expected 2023).
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   Future studies should also evaluate the association between
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   racial/ethnic segregation and inequalities in CWS metal concentration
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   estimates, especially because prior analyses of noise exposure^[234]70
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   and air pollution^[235]21,[236]73,[237]74 indicate that racial/ethnic
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   segregation is associated with exposure inequalities. Geographically
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   weighted regression indicated a positive association between larger
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   proportions of non-Hispanic Black residents and CWS arsenic in parts of
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   these particularly vulnerable geographic areas where metals in CWSs and
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   soil are particularly high (public water system distribution boundaries
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   are also publicly available for many of these states). Future analyses
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   should also assess whether changes in racial/ethnic composition and
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   migration patterns over time are associated with changes in CWS arsenic
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   and uranium concentrations over time.

../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   arsenic and N = 1174 for uranium. No counties were missing
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   racial/ethnic composition variables. We further restricted our analysis

../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   the proportion of residents of a given racial/ethnic group would be
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   zero or very near zero, and therefore effect estimates would be
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   extrapolated beyond the range of actual values), or bias results if

../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   between the five racial/ethnic composition variables and CWS mean
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   arsenic and uranium concentrations in 8 separate ordinary least squares
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   (OLS) linear models, regressing each CWS metal on each of the four
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   racial/ethnic composition variables (proportion of non-Hispanic Black,
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic White
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   residents). To assess global spatial autocorrelation, we visually
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   assessed the residuals from each OLS model and assessed Moran's I

../dumps-text/en-14.txt-
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   To quantify the association between county-level racial/ethnic
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   composition and CWS metal concentrations, we evaluated spatial lag
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   regression models with an autoregressive correlation structure
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   separately for CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations and for each of
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   the five racial/ethnic composition variables in R using the lagsarlm
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   function from the "spatialreg" package^[260]82. We assessed the
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   geometric mean ratio (GMR) and corresponding percent difference of CWS
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   arsenic and uranium concentrations per 10% higher proportion of
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   (Model 1) were adjusted for population density, the percent of public
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   drinking water sourced from groundwater supplies, median household
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   income, the percent of adults with a high school diploma. Model 2
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   further adjusted for the proportion of the other racial/ethnic groups
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   except for the proportion of non-Hispanic White residents. This
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   "leave-one-out" modeling approach is useful when proportional variables
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   sum to nearly 100% and higher proportions of one component occur
--
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   although effect estimates were generally stronger (results not shown).
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   Third, we repeated the analyses by assessing the geometric mean ratio
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   of CWS arsenic and uranium per change in the proportion of a given
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   racial/ethnic group that corresponds to (a) a 60% higher proportion of
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   residents, a common cut-point to identify racial/ethnic majority areas
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   in prior literature^[262]80, and (b) the value corresponding to the
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   interquartile range for the proportion of residents in the specified
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   racial/ethnic group, with similar findings for both approaches
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   (Supplementary Table [263]1). Fourth, we repeated the spatial lag
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   regression evaluating the association for higher proportions of
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   American Indian/Alaskan Native residents without adjusting for

../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   proportion of all residents who were not categorized as non-Hispanic
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   White, including non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native,
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
../dumps-text/en-14.txt:   Islander, and all residents in other racial/ethnic categories. This
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   sensitivity analysis is specifically intended to evaluate the
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   prediction that higher proportions of non-Hispanic White residents is
../dumps-text/en-14.txt-   associated with lower CWS metal concentrations.
