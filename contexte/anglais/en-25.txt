   Racial Discrimination In The USA

   The USA has had a very bad history when it comes to racial
   discrimination. The country in 18th century brought lot of slave
   workers and they all were from Africa and Asia. These people did not
   have any rights. The culture of racial discrimination continued for
   such a long time that it became embedded in the people's minds. Now its
   very natural for the people to see other races as unworthy and down.
   Many Indians have also faced a lot of problems in the past due to the
   racial abuse. The people do not get promotions in their jobs and they
   do not get equal salary as their white counterparts. Some are even
   subjected to violence. Lot of Indian Sikhs have been murdered and at
   the receiving end of physical abuse in the USA.

   On top of that Barack Obama said that religious tolerance in India has
   been going down!

   Formal racial discrimination was largely banned in the mid-20th
   century, and ... In the view of the U.S. Human Rights Network, a
   network of scores of US civil ...

   Dec 7, 2014 ... Addressing protests over minorities killed by police
   officers, President Obama said racism is "deeply rooted" in the U.S.
   and that activists should ...

   Nov 27, 2014 ... Whites and people of color speak a different language
   about racism. ... Bouie of Slate magazine in a recent essay, "The Gulf
   That Divides Us.".
