../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   Many white Americans believe that race is no longer central to one's
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   opportunities in life, and that we're well on our way to systemic
../dumps-text/en-16.txt:   racial equality. Are these beliefs accurate? While it's often difficult
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   to measure levels of discrimination over time, research into hiring
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   discrimination shows that black Americans still face discrimination in
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   the hiring process. A meta-analysis of callback rates from all existing

../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   Race is often at the forefront of American conversation. It has lately
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   emerged with new urgency around discussions of policing, immigration,
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   First Amendment rights, and even professional football. And yet even as
../dumps-text/en-16.txt:   we are confronted with [77]dramatic examples of ongoing racial
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   tensions, most white Americans remain convinced that [78]race is no
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   longer central to one's opportunities in life. [79]Polling data shows
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   that many believe these lingering conflicts represent the actions of a
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   few bad apples and aren't in sync with the larger trend toward systemic
../dumps-text/en-16.txt:   racial equality.

../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   Are these beliefs accurate? What do we know about long-term trends in
../dumps-text/en-16.txt:   racial discrimination?
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   Discrimination, given how it often manifests subtly, is notoriously
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   difficult to measure in any context. And until recently we have not had
--
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   discrimination over time. However, in [80]our recent study, published
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we were able to
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   analyze trends in discrimination by performing a meta-analysis from all
../dumps-text/en-16.txt:   available field experiments pertaining to one area: racial
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   discrimination in hiring. We focused on experiments performed since
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   1990, when field studies became more numerous and their
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   methodologically improved. We analyzed data from 24 field experiments,
--
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   treatment regardless of race has increased. Americans appear to have
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   become more concerned with diversity and inclusion and, [84]in a small
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   number of elite firms, affirmative action practices have made
../dumps-text/en-16.txt:   meaningful changes in the opportunities available to racial minorities.
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-
../dumps-text/en-16.txt:   At the same time, however, assessments of subtle forms of racial
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   stereotypes and measures of unconscious bias have [85]shown little
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   change [86]over time. The vast majority of hiring is subject to very
../dumps-text/en-16.txt:   little oversight, and compensatory policies that address racial bias
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   reach a very small fraction of hiring overall. Together, these trends
../dumps-text/en-16.txt:   offer little support for optimism about racial progress in the United
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   States. While some people may assume that discrimination has declined
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   over time, through increasing diversity in institutions along with
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   other cultural changes, it seems as though, at least in terms of
--
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   We believe that our results provide a strong rationale for affirmative
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   action policies and point to the continuing need for the enforcement of
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   antidiscrimination legislation. Even among well-intended employers,
../dumps-text/en-16.txt:   racial bias may lurk in hiring decisions. Whether conscious or not,
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   bias continues to affect decision making, and we find little evidence
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   that this pattern will diminish on its own. Instead, more active
../dumps-text/en-16.txt-   intervention may be needed to reduce discrimination at the point of
