../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   Here, we describe opportunities for COVID-19 response and recovery
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   efforts to help build more equal and resilient societies, through
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   investments in: (i) interventions focused on explicitly addressing
../dumps-text/en-38.txt:   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination; (ii) interventions
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   supporting the delivery of universal services, and in ways that address
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   compounding and intersecting drivers of exclusion and marginalization;

../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   of COVID-19 has been disproportionately felt by populations
../dumps-text/en-38.txt:   experiencing structural racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination.
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   Indeed, where disaggregated epidemiologic data are available, COVID-19
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   morbidity and mortality rates are often significantly higher among
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   people of African descent, indigenous peoples, and ethnic groups or
--
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   marginalization and discrimination that often have historical roots and
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   still have present-day manifestations^[79]7. Importantly, "race" is
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   purely a social construct that has no biological basis, and documented
../dumps-text/en-38.txt:   racial inequities are due to racism not genetics or biology.
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-
../dumps-text/en-38.txt:   Ethnicity-based and racial discrimination intersects with other forms
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   of exclusion based on income, occupation, gender identity and
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   expression, sexual orientation, disability, religion or belief,
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   language, migratory status, rural/urban status and more, and is
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   unlikely to exist in only one sector. Beyond health inequities,
../dumps-text/en-38.txt:   COVID-19 racial and ethnicity-based inequities have been documented
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   across employment, education, housing and food insecurity, among other
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   domains^[80]8. There are different pathways - from differential
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   exposure, to inequitable access to health services, to uneven

../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   As countries work to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   address both health challenges and broader socio-economic impacts,
../dumps-text/en-38.txt:   attention must be given to tackling racial and ethnic discrimination.
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   With this in mind, and consistent with the UN Secretary General's Call
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   to Action for Human Rights^[83]11, members of the United Nations
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   Sustainable Development Group released a report on opportunities to
../dumps-text/en-38.txt:   address racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination^[84]12.
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   The report was developed through a consultative process that began in
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   late 2020 through early 2021, involving UN senior executives and
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   technical staff, civil society, public health practitioners and human
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   rights experts. It identified three strategic approaches to addressing
../dumps-text/en-38.txt:   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination in COVID-19 response and
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   recovery efforts. These are: (i) interventions explicitly tackling
../dumps-text/en-38.txt:   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination, including improving
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   anti-discrimination and redress mechanisms; (ii) interventions
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   supporting the delivery of universal services, but in ways that address
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   compounding and intersecting drivers of social exclusion and draw on

../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   investments in cross-cutting enabling measures, such as participatory
../dumps-text/en-38.txt-   mechanisms and data disaggregation (see Table [86]1 which is replicated

../dumps-text/en-38.txt:   impact on populations experiencing racial and ethnicity-based
