../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   counterproductive behavioral patterns among blacks.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   This puts what is a very sensitive issue rather starkly. Many vocal
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   advocates for racial equality have been loath to consider the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   possibility that problematic patterns of behavior could be an important
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   factor contributing to our persisting disadvantaged status. Some
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   observers on the right of American politics, meanwhile, take the
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   influences, and do not benefit from the resources that foster and
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   facilitate their human development, they fail to achieve their full
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   human potential. This lack of development is what ultimately causes the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   persistent, stark racial disparities in income, wealth, education,
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   family structure, and much else. (The charts and tables on this and the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   next several pages offer a glimpse of the magnitude of these
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   disparities.)
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   bandied about without being rigorously defined. In a 2002 book, The
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Anatomy of Racial Inequality, I sketched a theory of race applicable to
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   the social and historical circumstances of the U.S., speculated about
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   why racial inequalities persist, and advanced a conceptual framework
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   for thinking about social justice in matters of race.[[150]1] Because
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   there remains so much confusion in today's public discussions about
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   race and racial inequality, I need to revisit that framework. Bear with
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   me. The relevance of this conceptual excursion will be clear soon
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   enough.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Anthony Appiah,[[153]4] deny that "race" refers to anything real. What
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   they have in mind is the biological-taxonomic notion, and what they
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   deny is that meaningful distinctions among human subgroups pertinent to
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   accounting for racial inequality can be derived from this notion. I am
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   not arguing this point--though it would appear to be eminently
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   arguable. What I am emphasizing is that to establish the scientific
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   invalidity of race demonstrates neither the irrationality nor the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   immorality of invoking racial classification as acts of social
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   cognition. So I shall employ the concept of race here, with an emphasis
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   on the negative interpretative/symbolic connotations attached to
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   "blackness" in the U.S.[[154]5]
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-Reward Bias Versus Development Bias
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Given this theoretical understanding of race, what might one say about
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   the causes of persistent racial inequality? Fundamental is the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   elemental distinction I first drew in 2002 between racial
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   discrimination and racial stigma. Discrimination is about how blacks
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   are treated; stigma is about how blacks are perceived.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   What I call "reward bias" (conventional racial discrimination) is now a
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   less significant barrier to the full participation of African-Americans
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   in U.S. society than what I call "development bias." Reward bias
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   focuses on the disadvantageous treatment of black people in formal
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   their talents but that are conveyed via informal social relations. This
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   is where the consideration of culture enters the picture.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   Reward bias is grounded in racially discriminatory transactions, but
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   development bias is ultimately rooted in racially stigmatized social
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   relations. Many resources that foster human development only become
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   available to persons as the by-product of informal, race-influenced
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   social interactions. Another way to put this expanded view of
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   and a regime of market discrimination under pressure from the forces of
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   economic competition may require informal instruments of social control
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   to maintain that discriminatory regime.[[155]6] Though both kinds of
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   bias promote racial inequality, the distinction is useful.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   The moral problem presented by reward bias is straightforward and calls
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   for an uncontroversial remedy: laws against overt racial
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   discrimination. Development bias presents a subtler and more insidious
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   ethical challenge that may be difficult to remedy via public policies
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   in any way that garners majoritarian support. Ultimately, development
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   bias deals with some cultural patterns that are characteristic of both
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   a racial minority group and the society at large, while reward bias
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   deals with overt antiblack discriminatory treatment that, even though
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   it has not been fully eliminated, is nevertheless nearly universally
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   condemned.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   The difficulties for remedying development bias have a cognitive and an
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   ethical dimension. In terms of cognition, when confronted with a racial
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   group's poor social performance, an observer may be unable to
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   distinguish between blocked developmental opportunities and limited
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   capacities or distorted values. In ethical terms, citizens who find the
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   discrimination" that underlies development bias.[[156]7]
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Regarding the distinction between reward bias and development bias: to
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   understand persistent racial inequality in America, it is crucial to
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   put relations before transactions. The focus on discriminatory economic
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   transactions may not be sufficient; one will need also to consider the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   consequences of racially stigmatized social relations. Stigma--the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   distorted social meanings attaching to "blackness"--inhibits the access
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   that some black people have to those networks of social affiliation
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   where developmental resources are most readily appropriated. This might
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   because we choose to be socially withdrawn.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   On this view, persistent inequality may no longer be due mainly to a
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   racially discriminatory marketplace, or an administrative state that
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   refuses to reward black talent equally, as was the case in decades
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   past. Rather, today's problem may be due, in large part, to a
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   race-tinged psychology of perception and valuation--a way of seeing
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   the acquisition of traits that are valued in the marketplace and are
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   essential for human development.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   This can lead to a vicious circle. The status of a racial group as
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   stigmatized in the social imagination--and crucially, in its own
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   self-understanding--can be rationalized and socially reproduced because
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   of that group's subordinate position in the economic order. Moreover,
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   this way of thinking implies that the explanatory categories of "racial
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   discrimination" and "racially distinct behaviors" are not mutually
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   exclusive.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-Social Capital Versus Human Capital
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   A quarter-century before the publication of The Anatomy of Racial
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Inequality, I coined the term "social capital" to help account for
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   persistent racial inequality in the U.S.[[157]8] The concept behind
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   social capital illuminates the difference between informal social
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   relations and formal economic transactions--between reward and
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   development bias--as mechanisms perpetuating the subordinate position
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   I argued that associating business with human investments is merely an
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   analogy, not an identity--particularly if one seeks to explain
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   persistent racial disparities. Human capital, as an economic concept,
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   overlooks two important facts having to do with informal social
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   relations.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   a mechanical infusion of material resources. Rather, these are
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   by-products of social processes mediated by networks of human
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   affiliation, and these processes are fundamentally important for
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   understanding persistent racial disparities.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Second, what we call "race" is mainly a social, and only indirectly a
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   biological, phenomenon. The persistence across generations of racial
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   differentiation between large groups of people, in an open society
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   where individuals live in proximity to one another, provides
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   irrefutable indirect evidence of a profound separation between the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   racially defined networks of social affiliation within that society.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   There would be no races in the steady state of any dynamic social
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   system unless, on a daily basis and with regard to their most intimate
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   affairs, people paid assiduous attention to the boundaries separating
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   themselves from racially distinct others. Over time, race would cease
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   to exist unless people chose to act in a manner so as biologically to
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   reproduce the variety of phenotypic expression that constitutes the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   substance of racial distinction.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   If the goal is to understand durable racial inequality in a society,
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   one needs to attend in detail to the processes that cause race to
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   persist as a fact of life, because such processes will be related to
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   the allocation of human developmental resources in that society.
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   about identity held by the people--in America, principally blacks and
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   whites alike--in that society. These are the beliefs that people hold
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   about who they are and about the legitimacy of conducting intimate
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   relations (and not only sexual relations) with racially distinct
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   others. Beliefs of this kind affect the access that people enjoy to
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   those informal resources that individuals require to develop their
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   human potential. Social capital is a critical prerequisite for creating
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   what economists refer to as human capital.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   Any conceptual framework for the study of persistent racial inequality
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   is incomplete if it fails to consider the interactions between those
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   social processes ensuring the reproduction of racial difference, on one
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   hand, and those processes facilitating human development, on the other
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   hand. If we consider these interactions, it becomes easier to see the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   many intimate connections between the antiblack "racial bias" that
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   liberals emphasize and the "behavioral pathology" of (some) blacks that
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   (some) conservatives are so keen to focus on.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   I know how difficult it can be to see those connections--it has taken
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   me many years to recognize them. My doctoral dissertation included an
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   essay that was very close to the liberal, "racial bias" narrative.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   History, I wrote, casts a long shadow. Contemporary racial inequality
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   in America reflects a history of deprivation, discrimination, and
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   dispossession of black people. We can't expect this problem to cure
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   itself. Thus, social justice rightly understood would involve some kind
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   of reparation. I didn't use that word, but I did advocate for some
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   intervention by the state on behalf of the explicit goal of racial
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   equality. Otherwise, I reasoned, we would be stuck indefinitely with
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   the consequences of an unjust past.[[158]9]
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   disparities that remain are shameful and are due in large part to the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   behaviors of black people.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   People tout the racial wealth gap as, ipso facto, an indictment of the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   system--even while black Caribbean and African immigrants are starting
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   businesses, penetrating the professions, and presenting themselves at
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Ivy League institutions in outsize numbers. They are behaving, although
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Thus, the Obama administration's Department of Education issued a "Dear
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Colleague Letter"[[162]13] that sought to cajole local school districts
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   around the country to narrow the racial disparity in the suspension
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   rates of students for disruptive behavior. The letter was supposedly
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   advice--but failure to narrow the disparity meant that the district
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   could be found guilty of a civil rights violation and potentially lose
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   discipline students, the Department of Education and the Department of
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Justice should get involved. But based on all that we know--for
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   instance, about crime and incarceration rates--it is at least plausible
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   that there is an objective racial disparity in the frequency of
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   disruptive behavior that occasions a difference in the suspension
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   statistics. If behavior, not racism, is at the bottom of racially
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   disparate suspension rates, think of the disservice being done--to the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   schoolchildren who act out (by failing to teach the lesson that bad
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   behavior has consequences), to classmates (including, of course,
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   the soft bigotry of low expectations. Yet other than Clarence Thomas,
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Thomas Sowell, and a few others, there is not even a debate among
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   African-Americans about what should be a first-order question, if the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   goal is to attain genuine racial equality.

../dumps-text/en-13.txt-Not All Black People Are the Same
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   All this having been said about the behavioral roots of racial
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   inequality, it is dangerous to talk about "black culture" as if it were
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   only one thing--with pathological behavior (such as high levels of
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   urban violence) becoming a stereotype about all black people. Here an
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   insight by UCLA sociologist Rogers Brubaker is crucial for
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   understanding race and inequality: one should never invoke racial
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   aggregates as the subjects of social analysis unreflectively.[[163]14]
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   This is a major concern among African-Americans about "culture talk."
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   opportunities are scant. It is no surprise that those incarcerated for
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   street-level trafficking are disproportionately blacks. Their arrests
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   and imprisonment are not in themselves evidence of racism--or evidence
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   of black culture. But given the bare facts of racial stigma in American
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   society, many observers will be inclined to think so.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-We're All in This Together--at Least We're Supposed to Be
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   This point about racial stigma is fundamental. Without understanding
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   it, one might say (as many conservative commentators do), "Look at
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   recent immigrants from Asia and even from Latin America. They, too,
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   have been victims in various ways. Yet they have advanced in our

../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   flourishing, or lack thereof, reflects on society as a whole, as well
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   as on themselves. It reflects on an "us," not merely on "them."
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   The mistake is to ignore the extent to which racial inequality reflects
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   not only cultural patterns among insular groups of people but also the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   interactions that run through society. To impute a causal role to what
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   one takes to be intrinsic cultural traits of a subordinate racial
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   group, while failing to see the systemwide context out of which
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   dysfunctional cultural patterns emerged, is to commit a significant
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   error of social cognition. That members of a particular group seem to

../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   these that entangle us together.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Consider the high out-of-wedlock birthrates among blacks. This pattern
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   of behavior has consequences for socioeconomic racial disparities. But
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   that is not the whole story.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Racial intermarriage rates in the U.S. remain quite low (though they

../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   and, on the basis of that observation, to impute the difference to
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   something called black culture, reflects one's failure to see how the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   intra-racial marriage market is nested within a larger context, where a
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   higher rate of cross-boundary mating could substantially alter
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   intra-boundary behavior.

../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   The perspective I am promoting about social capital does not require

../dumps-text/en-13.txt-Conclusion: Who Are We?
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   How should we think about the persistence of racial inequality in
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   America? To deny the relevance of behavioral patterns among some black
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   families and communities is folly. To wash one's hands of their
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   problems because of such cultural and behavioral impediments is
--
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   While we cannot ignore the behavioral problems of the so-called black
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   underclass, we should discuss and react to those problems as if we were
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   talking about our own children, neighbors, and friends. It will require
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   adjusting ways of thinking on both sides of the racial divide.
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   Achieving a well-ordered society, where all members are embraced as
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   being among us, should be the goal. Our failure to do so is an American
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   tragedy. It is a national, not merely a communal, disgrace. Changing
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   the definition of the American "we" is a first step toward rectifying
../dumps-text/en-13.txt-   the relational discrimination that afflicts our society, and it is the
../dumps-text/en-13.txt:   best path forward in reducing racial inequality.
