../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   The Death Penalty Information Center has released a major new report on
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   race and the U.S. death penalty, providing an in-depth look at the
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   historical role race has played in the death penalty and detailing the
../dumps-text/en-18.txt:   pervasive impact racial discrimination continues to have throughout
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   every stage of a death penalty case today. [141]Enduring Injustice: the
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   Persistence of Racial Discrimination in the U.S. Death Penalty.
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   released on September 15, 2020, also makes the case for why redressing
--
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   The Memphis Commercial Appeal noted that the report was released in an
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   environment of social upheaval in which "[o]pponents of the death
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   penalty are finding their arguments about the history of
../dumps-text/en-18.txt:   state-sanctioned executions fit into a wider discourse about racial
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   injustice amid nationwide protests against police brutality and
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   racism."
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   Ngozi Ndulue, DPIC's Senior Director of Research and Special Projects
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   and the author of the report, agreed. "We have seen more explicit
../dumps-text/en-18.txt:   reference to the continued racial discrimination in the death penalty
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   in the last few months," she told the Commercial Appeal. "This is a
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   moment that advocates are really looking for concrete changes and what
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   we're trying to do with this report -- the bulk of it was written
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   before the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd --
../dumps-text/en-18.txt:   ties really into the moment of reckoning of racial justice the country
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   is having right now."
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   The report documents the historic role the U.S. death penalty has
--
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   population," the report says. "By 1848, white people could be sentenced
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   to death only for first-degree murder while enslaved Black people could
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   be executed for a number of non-homicide offenses." By the 20^th
../dumps-text/en-18.txt:   century, the racial categorization of crimes was gone from the law
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   books but was retained in practice. From 1900 through 1969, the report
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   shows, 258 African Americans were executed, as compared to 46 whites.
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   Forty-eight Black men were executed for rape, 20 for attempted rape,
--
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   the alleged rape or attempted rape of white women or girls. No white
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   man was ever executed for raping a Black woman or girl.
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-
../dumps-text/en-18.txt:   The report also explains that racial bias persists today, as evidenced
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   by cases with white victims being more likely to be investigated and
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   capitally charged; systemic exclusion of jurors of color from service
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   in death-penalty trials; and disproportionate imposition of death
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   sentences against defendants of color. "The death penalty has been used
../dumps-text/en-18.txt:   to enforce racial hierarchies throughout United States history,
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   beginning with the colonial period and continuing to this day," Ndulue
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   said.
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-
--
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-       jurors. As of 2010, 20 percent of those on the state's death row
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-       were sentenced to death by all-white juries.
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-     * Data showing that since executions resumed in 1977, 295
../dumps-text/en-18.txt:       African-American defendants have been executed for interracial
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-       murders of white victims, while only 21 white defendants have been
../dumps-text/en-18.txt:       executed for interracial murders of African Americans.
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-     * A 2014 mock jury study of more than 500 Californians that found
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-       white jurors were more likely to sentence poor Latinx defendants to
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-       death than poor white defendants.
--
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   With the continuing police and white vigilante killings of Black
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   citizens, it is even more important now to focus attention on the
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   outsized role the death penalty plays as an agent and validator of
../dumps-text/en-18.txt:   racial discrimination. What is broken or intentionally discriminatory
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   in the criminal legal system is visibly worse in death-penalty cases.
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   Exposing how the system discriminates in capital cases can shine an
../dumps-text/en-18.txt-   important light on law enforcement and judicial practices in vital need
