Overview

   The United States criminal justice system is the largest in the world.
   At yearend 2015, over 6.7 million individuals[58]^1 were under some
   form of correctional control in the United States, including 2.2
   million incarcerated in federal, state, or local prisons and
   jails.[59]^2 The U.S. is a world leader in its rate of incarceration,
   dwarfing the rate of nearly every other nation.[60]^3

   Such broad statistics mask the racial disparity that pervades the U.S.
   criminal justice system, and for African Americans in particular.
   African Americans are more likely than white Americans to be arrested;
   once arrested, they are more likely to be convicted; and once
   convicted, and they are more likely to experience lengthy prison
   sentences. African-American adults are 5.9 times as likely to be
   incarcerated than whites and Hispanics are 3.1 times as likely.[61]^4
   As of 2001, one of every three black boys born in that year could
   expect to go to prison in his lifetime, as could one of every six
   Latinos--compared to one of every seventeen white boys.[62]^5 Racial
   and ethnic disparities among women are less substantial than among men
   but remain prevalent.[63]^6

   The source of such disparities is deeper and more systemic than
   explicit racial discrimination. The United States in effect operates
   two distinct criminal justice systems: one for wealthy people and
   another for poor people and people of color. The wealthy can access a
   vigorous adversary system replete with constitutional protections for
   defendants. Yet the experiences of poor and minority defendants within
   the criminal justice system often differ substantially from that model
   due to a number of factors, each of which contributes to the
   overrepresentation of such individuals in the system. As former
   Georgetown Law Professor David Cole states in his book No Equal
   Justice,

   These double standards are not, of course, explicit; on the face of it,
   the criminal law is color-blind and class-blind. But in a sense, this
   only makes the problem worse. The rhetoric of the criminal justice
   system sends the message that our society carefully protects everyone's
   constitutional rights, but in practice the rules assure that law
   enforcement prerogatives will generally prevail over the rights of
   minorities and the poor. By affording criminal suspects substantial
   constitutional rights in theory, the Supreme Court validates the
   results of the criminal justice system as fair. That formal fairness
   obscures the systemic concerns that ought to be raised by the fact that
   the prison population is overwhelmingly poor and disproportionately
   black.[64]^7

   By creating and perpetuating policies that allow such racial
   disparities to exist in its criminal justice system, the United States
   is in violation of its obligations under Article 2 and Article 26 of
   the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to ensure that
   all its residents--regardless of race--are treated equally under the
   law. The Sentencing Project notes that the United Nations Special
   Rapporteur is working to consult with U.S. civil society organizations
   on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, and related
   intolerance. We welcome this opportunity to provide the UN Special
   Rapporteur with an accurate assessment of racial disparity in the U.S.
   criminal justice system.

   Established in 1986, The Sentencing Project works for a fair and
   effective U.S. criminal justice system by promoting reforms in
   sentencing policy, addressing unjust racial disparities and practices,
   and advocating for alternatives to incarceration. Staff of The
   Sentencing Project have testified before the U.S. Congress and state
   legislative bodies and have submitted amicus curiae briefs to the
   Supreme Court of the United States on various issues related to
   incarceration and criminal justice policy. The organization's research
   findings are regularly relied upon by policymakers and covered by major
   news outlets.

   This report chronicles the racial disparity that permeates every stage
   of the United States criminal justice system, from arrest to trial to
   sentencing to post prison experiences. In particular, the report
   highlights research findings that address rates of racial disparity and
   their underlying causes throughout the criminal justice system. The
   report concludes by offering recommendations on ways that federal,
   state, and local officials in the United States can work to eliminate
   racial disparity in the criminal justice system and uphold its
   obligations under the Covenant.

Racial Disparity in the United States Criminal Justice System

A. Policing

   In 2016, black Americans comprised 27% of all individuals arrested in
   the United States--double their share of the total population.[65]^8
   Black youth accounted for 15% of all U.S. children yet made up 35% of
   juvenile arrests in that year.[66]^9 What might appear at first to be a
   linkage between race and crime is in large part a function of
   concentrated urban poverty, which is far more common for African
   Americans than for other racial groups. This accounts for a substantial
   portion of African Americans' increased likelihood of committing
   certain violent and property crimes.[67]^10 But while there is a higher
   black rate of involvement in certain crimes, white Americans
   overestimate the proportion of crime committed by blacks and Latinos,
   overlook the fact that communities of color are disproportionately
   victims of crime, and discount the prevalence of bias in the criminal
   justice system.[68]^11

   In 1968, the Kerner Commission called on the country to make "massive
   and sustained" investments in jobs and education to reverse the
   "segregation and poverty [that] have created in the racial ghetto a
   destructive environment totally unknown to most white
   Americans."[69]^12 Fifty years later, the Commission's lone surviving
   member concluded that "in many ways, things have gotten no better--or
   have gotten worse."[70]^13

   The rise of mass incarceration begins with disproportionate levels of
   police contact with African Americans. This is striking in particular
   for drug offenses, which are committed at roughly equal rates across
   races. "One reason minorities are stopped disproportionately is because
   police see violations where they are," said Louis Dekmar, the president
   of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and chief of
   LaGrange, Georgia's police department.[71]^14 The chief added: "Crime
   is often significantly higher in minority neighborhoods than elsewhere.
   And that is where we allocate our resources." Dekmar's view is not
   uncommon. Absent meaningful efforts to address societal segregation and
   disproportionate levels of poverty, U.S. criminal justice policies have
   cast a dragnet targeting African Americans. The War on Drugs as well as
   policing policies including "Broken Windows" and "Stop, Question, and
   Frisk" sanction higher levels of police contact with African Americans.
   This includes higher levels of police contact with innocent people and
   higher levels of arrests for drug crimes. Thus:
     * More than one in four people arrested for drug law violations in
       2015 was black, although drug use rates do not differ substantially
       by race and ethnicity and drug users generally purchase drugs from
       people of the same race or ethnicity.[72]^15 For example, the ACLU
       found that blacks were 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for
       marijuana possession than whites in 2010, even though their rate of
       marijuana usage was comparable.[73]^16
     * The highest officials in New York City had "turned a blind eye to
       the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially
       discriminatory manner," Judge Shira A. Scheindlin concluded
       regarding the city's stop-and-frisk tactic, declaring it
       unconstitutional in 2013.[74]^17 The policy, which broadly targeted
       male residents of neighborhoods populated by low-income people of
       color to uncover drugs and weapons, was shown to be ineffective,
       and this assessment was further validated when New York City
       continued its crime decline after scaling back Stop and Frisk. Yet
       other localities continue to deploy the practice.[75]^18
     * New York City, like many other cities, remains reluctant to scale
       back Broken Windows Policing, a public safety approach that relies
       on clamping down on petty offenses and neighborhood disorder.
       Between 2001 and 2013, 51% of the city's population over age 16 was
       black or Hispanic. Yet during that period, 82% of those arrested
       for misdemeanors were black or Hispanic, as were 81% of those who
       received summonses for violations of the administrative code
       (including such behaviors as public consumption of alcohol,
       disorderly conduct, and bicycling on the sidewalk.).[76]^19 Yet
       research shows that order-maintenance strategies have had only a
       modest impact on serious crime rates and have caused great damage
       to communities of color.[77]^20 These strategies also expose people
       of color to a greater risk of being killed during a police
       encounter.

   In addition to pursuing policies that bring little gain in crime
   reduction and impose great costs on people of color, policymakers and
   criminal justice leaders have been late to address discriminatory
   policies for which they provide no justification--such as biased use of
   officer discretion and revenue-driven policing. Thus:
     * In recent years, black drivers have been somewhat more likely to be
       stopped than whites but have been far more likely to be searched
       and arrested.[78]^21 The causes and outcomes of these stops differ
       by race, and staggering racial disparities in rates of police stops
       persist in certain jurisdictions--pointing to unchecked racial
       bias, whether intentional or not, in officer discretion. A closer
       look at the causes of traffic stops reveals that police are more
       likely to stop black and Hispanic drivers for discretionary
       reasons--for "investigatory stops" (proactive stops used to
       investigate drivers deemed suspicious) rather than "traffic-safety
       stops" (reactive stops used to enforce traffic laws or vehicle
       codes).[79]^22 Nationwide surveys also reveal disparities in the
       outcomes of police stops. Once pulled over, black and Hispanic
       drivers were three times as likely as whites to be searched (6% and
       7% versus 2%) and blacks were twice as likely as whites to be
       arrested.[80]^23 These patterns hold even though police officers
       generally have a lower "contraband hit rate" when they search black
       versus white drivers.[81]^24
     * "Ferguson's law enforcement practices are shaped by the City's
       focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs," the Civil
       Rights Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) concluded in
       2015, after the police killing of Michael Brown brought national
       attention to police-community tensions in the St. Louis, Missouri
       suburb.[82]^25 The DOJ found that black residents' disproportionate
       rate of police stops, searches, and arrests resulted from city
       officials' growing reliance on municipal fines and fees which
       police officers and court officers were exhorted to deliver through
       aggressive enforcement of traffic violations and petty offenses.
       ArchCity Defenders, authors of an early and influential white paper
       on the troubled municipal court system, has demonstrated that many
       other St. Louis municipalities have similar or worse practices than
       Ferguson.[83]^26

B. Pretrial

   African Americans were incarcerated in local jails at a rate 3.5 times
   that of non-Hispanic whites in 2016.[84]^27 These disparities stem in
   part from the policies and practices of policing described earlier, but
   are compounded by those introduced at this stage of processing. Given
   that nearly two-thirds (65%) of people in jail in 2016 were being
   detained prior to trial, policies and decisions influencing pretrial
   detention play a key role in driving the disparity in the jail
   population and beyond.[85]^27

   Pretrial detention has been shown to increase the odds of conviction,
   and people who are detained awaiting trial are also more likely to
   accept less favorable plea deals, to be sentenced to prison, and to
   receive longer sentences. Seventy percent of pretrial releases require
   money bond, an especially high hurdle for low-income defendants, who
   are disproportionately people of color.[86]^29 Blacks and Latinos are
   more likely than whites to be denied bail, to have a higher money bond
   set, and to be detained because they cannot pay their bond.[87]^29 They
   are often assessed to be higher safety and flight risks because they
   are more likely to experience socioeconomic disadvantage and to have
   criminal records. Implicit bias also contributes to people of color
   faring worse than comparable whites in bail determinations.

C. Sentencing

   Although African Americans and Latinos comprise 29% of the U.S.
   population, they make up 57% of the U.S. prison population.[88]^31 This
   results in imprisonment rates for African-American and Hispanic adults
   that are 5.9 and 3.1 times the rate for white adults, respectively--and
   at far higher levels in some states.[89]^32 Notably, these disparities
   exist for both the least and most serious offenses:
     * Of the 277,000 people imprisoned nationwide for a drug offense,
       over half (56%) are African American or Latino.[90]^33
     * Nearly half (48%) of the 206,000 people serving life and "virtual
       life" prison sentences are African American and another 15% are
       Latino.[91]^34

   Among youth, African Americans are 4.1 times as likely to be committed
   to secure placements as whites, American Indians are 3.1 times as
   likely, and Hispanics are 1.5 times as likely.[92]^35 Although levels
   of youth confinement have significantly declined in recent years, the
   racial gap between black and American Indian versus white youth has
   increased.[93]^36

   The racial disparities in the adult and juvenile justice systems stem
   in part from the policing and pretrial factors described earlier, and
   are compounded by discretionary decisions and sentencing policies that
   disadvantage people of color because of their race or higher rates of
   socioeconomic disadvantage.[94]^20 These include:
     * Biased use of discretion: Prosecutors are more likely to charge
       people of color with crimes that carry heavier sentences than
       whites. Federal prosecutors, for example, are twice as likely to
       charge African Americans with offenses that carry a mandatory
       minimum sentence than similarly situated whites.[95]^38 State
       prosecutors are also more likely to charge black rather than
       similar white defendants under habitual offender laws.[96]^39
     * Policies that disadvantage people of color: Drug-free school zone
       laws mandate sentencing enhancements for people caught selling
       drugs in designated school zones. The expansive geographic range of
       these zones coupled with high urban density has disproportionately
       affected residents of urban areas, and particularly those in
       high-poverty areas - who are largely people of color.[97]^40
       Legislators in New Jersey scaled back their state law after a study
       found that 96% of persons subject to these enhancements were
       African American or Latino. All 50 states and the District of
       Columbia have some form of drug-free school zone law.
     * Policies that disadvantage poor people: Most jurisdictions
       inadequately fund their indigent defense programs. While there are
       many high-quality public defender offices, in far too many cases
       indigent individuals are represented by public defenders with
       excessively high caseloads, or by assigned counsel with limited
       experience in criminal defense. Public defenders in Louisiana have
       recently sued the state and those in Kansas City, Missouri have
       protested their crushing caseloads.[98]^41

D. Parole

   During the era of mass incarceration, a declining proportion of the
   prison population has a sentence that allows for discretionary release
   on parole, as lawmakers have required courts to shift from
   indeterminate sentences (whose release requires a discretionary parole
   decision) to fixed-term sentences (which have set release
   dates).[99]^42 Among sentences that allow for discretionary parole
   release, the process can be harder for people of color. Some research
   suggests that parole boards are influenced by an applicant's race in
   their decision making, though more research is needed in this
   area.[100]^43 Racial bias among correctional officers also shapes
   parole outcomes. As revealed by a New York Times investigation on New
   York prisons, comparable in-prison conduct--a major determinant of
   parole decisions--may result in divergent prison disciplinary records
   for blacks and Latinos versus whites.[101]^44 Based on an analysis of
   almost 60,000 disciplinary cases from the state's prisons, reporters
   found that disparities in discipline were greatest for infractions that
   gave discretion to guards, such as disobeying a direct order.

   Underinvestment and racial disparities also persist in community
   supervision--with many parole and probation systems offering
   supervision with little support, and with evidence that parole and
   probation officers are more likely to revoke people of color than
   whites for comparable behavior. For example, the Urban Institute's
   examination of probation revocation rates in Dallas County, Texas;
   Iowa's Sixth Judicial District; Multnomah County, Oregon; and New York
   City revealed that black probationers were revoked at disproportionate
   rates in all study sites at levels which "raise concerns about the
   presence of bias to the disadvantage of black probationers."

E. Post Prison/Collateral Consequences

   African Americans--particularly black men--are most exposed to the
   collateral consequences associated with a criminal record. In 2010, 8%
   of all adults in the United States had a felony conviction on their
   record.[102]^45 Among African-American men, the rate was one in three
   (33%).[103]^45 People with criminal records face a host of obstacles to
   re-enter society even after they have fully completed their term of
   incarceration or community supervision. These include barriers to
   securing steady employment and housing, to accessing the social safety
   net and federal student aid, and to exercising the right to vote.

   Nearly one-third of U.S. workers hold jobs that require an occupational
   license, a requirement which sometimes bars and often poses cumbersome
   obstacles for people with criminal records.[104]^47 In sectors that do
   not require licensing, employers are 50% less likely to call back white
   job applicants with incarceration histories than comparable applicants
   without prison records.[105]^48 African American job applicants, who
   are less likely to receive callbacks than whites to begin with,
   experience an even more pronounced discrimination related to a criminal
   record. As scholar Devah Pager's research has revealed, whites with
   criminal records receive more favorable treatment than blacks without
   criminal records.[106]^48 People with criminal convictions also face
   discrimination in the private rental market and those with felony drug
   convictions face restrictions in accessing government-assisted
   housing.[107]^50

   The Welfare Reform Act of 1996 imposed a lifetime denial of cash
   assistance and food stamps to people convicted in state or federal
   courts of felony drug offenses, unless states opt out of the
   ban.[108]^51 Given the dynamics of social class and the accompanying
   disparate racial effects of the criminal justice system, women and
   children of color are disproportionately impacted by this exclusionary
   law.[109]^51 By 2018, 24 states had fully opted out of the food stamp
   ban, 21 others had only done so in part, and five states continued to
   fully enforce the ban.[110]^53 An even larger number of states continue
   to impose a partial or full ban on cash assistance for people with
   felony drug convictions.[111]^53

   Disenfranchisement patterns have also reflected the dramatic growth and
   disproportionate impact of criminal convictions. A record 6.1 million
   Americans were forbidden from voting because of their felony record in
   2016, rising from 1.2 million in 1976.[112]^55 Felony
   disenfranchisement rates for voting-age African Americans reached 7.4%
   in 2016--four times the rate of non-African Americans (1.8%).[113]^55
   In three states, more than one in five voting-age African Americans is
   disenfranchised: Florida, Kentucky, and Tennessee.[114]^57 The majority
   of disenfranchised Americans are living in their communities, having
   fully completed their sentences or remaining supervised while on
   probation or parole.

Recommendations to the UN Special Rapporteur

   As the research presented in this report indicates, the causes of the
   racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system are complex and
   deeply rooted. As studies repeatedly demonstrate, the cumulative impact
   of racial disparity is experienced throughout the country's criminal
   justice system. Beliefs that the current system is unaffected by
   centuries of an explicitly racist past is wishful thinking and
   potentially blinds decision makers to the implicit racial bias that
   orients the American consciousness and is embedded in its formal
   policies.

   The United States can adopt concrete measures to reduce both the
   existence and the effects of racial bias in its criminal justice
   system. As such, The Sentencing Project respectfully urges the UN
   Special Rapporteur to recommend that the United States adopt the
   following recommendations.

End the War on Drugs.

   The United States should substantially end its War on Drugs.
   Specifically, the Department of Justice should reconsider and reduce
   the volume of low-level drug offenders prosecuted in federal court.
   State officials can also adopt law changes to divert prison-bound
   defendants into effective alternatives to incarceration programs. Local
   police departments should significantly scale back drug arrests. The
   resources saved by decreasing the number of prosecutions should be
   invested in evidence-based drug prevention and treatment measures.

Eliminate mandatory minimum sentences.

   The United States should eliminate mandatory minimum sentences. Judges
   should be allowed to consider individual case characteristics when
   sentencing a defendant in every case. Mandatory sentences do not
   eliminate discretion in the courtroom--they simply shift it from judges
   to prosecutors, thereby reducing transparency in decision making.

Reduce the Use of Cash Bail.

   Defendants should be detained pretrial only if they pose a safety or
   flight risk, not because they cannot afford to post bail. A well
   calibrated and transparent risk-assessment instrument can be used to
   determine who should be released on their own recognizance, who should
   be released with some requirements, and who should be detained.

Fully fund indigent defense agencies.

   The United States should fully fund and staff indigent defense agencies
   through an appropriate mix of local, state, and federal resources. The
   federal government should increase support for training and technical
   assistance for indigent defense, and document shortcomings of
   jurisdictions that fail to meet established bar association standards
   for caseloads and professional training.

Adopt a policy requiring the use of racial impact statements.

   Policies should be adopted at the federal and state levels requiring
   the use of racial impact statements for proposed sentencing policies.
   Such a policy would require legislators to prepare an analysis
   assessing the possible disparate racial consequences of any proposed
   legislation before enacting it in order to avoid any unintended
   disparate racial effects.[115]^58 Four states--Iowa, Connecticut,
   Oregon, and New Jersey--have adopted racial impact statement
   requirements since 2008.

Develop and implement training to reduce racial bias.

   The United States should develop and implement training designed to
   mitigate the influence of implicit racial bias at every level of the
   criminal justice system: police officers, public defenders,
   prosecutors, judges, jury members, and parole boards. While it is
   difficult to eliminate completely racial bias at the individual level,
   studies have repeatedly shown that it is possible to control for the
   effects of implicit racial bias on individual decision-making.[116]^59
   In other words, while it may be impossible in the current culture of
   the United States to ensure that individuals are cognitively
   colorblind, it is possible to train individuals to be behaviorally
   colorblind.[117]^60 The United States should work with leading scholars
   on implicit bias to develop the most effective training programs, and
   couple this with systems of monitoring and accountability to reduce the
   influence of implicit racial bias.

Address Collateral Consequences.

   Denying the right to vote to an entire class of citizens is deeply
   problematic to a democratic society and counterproductive to effective
   reentry. The federal government should allow Americans to vote
   regardless of their conviction status, and certainly after they have
   concluded their sentences. States should also allow the full democratic
   participation of their citizens. Government officials should also
   revise policies that serve no public safety function but impose
   collateral consequences on people with criminal convictions--such as in
   the realms of employment, education, housing, and in the social safety
   net--and encourage similar reforms in the private sector.

Conclusion

   For decades, the United States of America has employed mass
   incarceration as a convenient answer to inconvenient questions. These
   policies have produced dramatic rates of incarceration, with a
   particularly disproportionate impact on communities of color. In
   addition to the range of harmful consequences to people of color, mass
   incarceration has been a failed policy in regard to public safety
   outcomes. Research has documented that the effect of imprisonment on
   crime rates has been modest, and that at current levels the scale of
   incarceration is well past the point of diminishing returns for public
   safety. Mass incarceration has diverted resources from prevention and
   treatment initiatives that could have produced far more effective
   approaches to crime reduction.

   In recent years, the U.S. government has addressed some of the glaring
   racial inequalities that permeate every aspect of its criminal justice
   system, but these efforts have been relatively modest in scope. The
   government continues to both foster and perpetuate inequalities in
   clear violation of its obligations under the International Covenant on
   Civil and Political Rights as well as other international agreements.

   The proliferation of racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice
   system has a profound impact on the lives of people of color. Behind
   each statistic lies the face of a young black man or woman whose
   potential has been cut short by a harsh prison sentence mandated by
   draconian drug laws. Behind each percentage point lies the face of a
   Latina child who will only know her parents through hurried, awkward
   visits in a prison visitation room. Behind each dataset lies a
   community of color bereft of hope because its young people have been
   locked away.

   It is the human face--a face of color--of the racial injustice of the
   United States criminal justice system that is the most compelling
   reason for reform. It is time for the United States to take affirmative
   steps to eliminate the racial disparities in its criminal justice
   system.
