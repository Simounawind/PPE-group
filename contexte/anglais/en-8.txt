../dumps-text/en-8.txt:   on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, and related

../dumps-text/en-8.txt-Recommendations to the UN Special Rapporteur
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   As the research presented in this report indicates, the causes of the
../dumps-text/en-8.txt:   racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system are complex and
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   deeply rooted. As studies repeatedly demonstrate, the cumulative impact
../dumps-text/en-8.txt:   of racial disparity is experienced throughout the country's criminal
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   justice system. Beliefs that the current system is unaffected by
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   centuries of an explicitly racist past is wishful thinking and
../dumps-text/en-8.txt:   potentially blinds decision makers to the implicit racial bias that
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   orients the American consciousness and is embedded in its formal
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   policies.
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   The United States can adopt concrete measures to reduce both the
../dumps-text/en-8.txt:   existence and the effects of racial bias in its criminal justice
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   system. As such, The Sentencing Project respectfully urges the UN
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   Special Rapporteur to recommend that the United States adopt the
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   following recommendations.

../dumps-text/en-8.txt:   the use of racial impact statements for proposed sentencing policies.
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   Such a policy would require legislators to prepare an analysis
../dumps-text/en-8.txt:   assessing the possible disparate racial consequences of any proposed
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   legislation before enacting it in order to avoid any unintended
../dumps-text/en-8.txt:   disparate racial effects.[115]^58 Four states--Iowa, Connecticut,

../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   prosecutors, judges, jury members, and parole boards. While it is
../dumps-text/en-8.txt:   difficult to eliminate completely racial bias at the individual level,
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   studies have repeatedly shown that it is possible to control for the
../dumps-text/en-8.txt:   effects of implicit racial bias on individual decision-making.[116]^59
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   In other words, while it may be impossible in the current culture of
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   the United States to ensure that individuals are cognitively
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   colorblind, it is possible to train individuals to be behaviorally
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   colorblind.[117]^60 The United States should work with leading scholars
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   on implicit bias to develop the most effective training programs, and
../dumps-text/en-8.txt-   couple this with systems of monitoring and accountability to reduce the
