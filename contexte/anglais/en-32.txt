../dumps-text/en-32.txt-
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   A United Nations committee that is reviewing U.S. compliance with an
../dumps-text/en-32.txt:   international treaty on racial discrimination has issued findings that
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   should be seen as a serious rebuke and wakeup call for the Biden
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   administration.

../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   Especially noteworthy was CERD's focus on issues contained in specific
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   recommendations that the Southern Poverty Law Center submitted to the
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   committee earlier in August. These issues included hate and extremism
../dumps-text/en-32.txt:   as well as racial disparities in voting, health care, education, the
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   criminal legal system and immigration.

../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   The SPLC [67]went to Geneva, Switzerland, as part of a coalition of
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   more than 70 advocates from U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations
../dumps-text/en-32.txt:   (NGOs), to provide documentation to CERD of ongoing racial
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   discrimination and disparities in the U.S. We submitted [68]three
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   reports in advance of the review and traveled with a [69]delegation
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   that included two formerly incarcerated people who shared their

../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   At the same time, it's deeply troubling that the U.S. has not done more
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   to implement the treaty, the oldest of nine core international human
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   rights accords. The U.S. has ratified only three of the nine. The U.S.
../dumps-text/en-32.txt:   signed the treaty on racial discrimination in 1966 but did not ratify
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   it until 1994.

../dumps-text/en-32.txt-Prisons
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   The committee raised concerns about the continued overrepresentation of
../dumps-text/en-32.txt:   racial and ethnic minorities in the prison population and specifically
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   about their being disproportionately held in solitary confinement for
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   long periods of time. SPLC community partner [73]Terrance Winn, also a

../dumps-text/en-32.txt-
../dumps-text/en-32.txt:   In alignment with our submission on racial disparities in health care,
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   the committee expressed concerns about lack of access to adequate
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   health care in states that did not expand Medicaid, recommending
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   expanded coverage programs to ensure that everyone has such access.
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   Our submission to the committee on health care disparities also
../dumps-text/en-32.txt:   included information on racially disparate maternal and infant
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   mortality rates and the impact that the Supreme Court's [75]Dobbs
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   decision and state abortion restrictions will have on health and health
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   care in the Deep South states where we work. We were pleased to see
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   that that the committee raised the same concerns and urged measures to
../dumps-text/en-32.txt:   combat the racially disproportionate impact of these issues.

../dumps-text/en-32.txt:   voucher programs that are exacerbating racial segregation in schools
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   around the country.
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-
../dumps-text/en-32.txt:   It was also concerned about racially disproportionate school discipline
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   and policing.
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   The committee recommended development of a comprehensive national plan
../dumps-text/en-32.txt:   on socioeconomic and racial school segregation, along with measures to
../dumps-text/en-32.txt-   pressure states to address funding disparities and to combat school
