../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   Center (DPIC) today released, [144]"Enduring Injustice: the Persistence
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   of Racial Discrimination in the U.S. Death Penalty." This report
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   provides an in-depth look at the historical role that race has played
../dumps-text/en-40.txt:   in the death penalty and details the pervasive role racial
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   discrimination continues to play in the administration of capital
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   punishment today.
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-
../dumps-text/en-40.txt:   "The death penalty has been used to enforce racial hierarchies
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   throughout United States history, beginning with the colonial period
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   and continuing to this day," said Ngozi Ndulue, DPIC's Senior Director
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   of Research and Special Projects and the report's lead author. "Its
--
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   won't understand why. With the continuing police and white vigilante
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   killings of Black citizens, it is even more important now to focus
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   attention on the outsized role the death penalty plays as an agent and
../dumps-text/en-40.txt:   validator of racial discrimination. What is broken or intentionally
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   discriminatory in the criminal legal system is visibly worse in
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   death-penalty cases. Exposing how the system discriminates in capital
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   cases can shine an important light on law enforcement and judicial
--
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   being more likely to be investigated and capitally charged; systemic
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   exclusion of jurors of color from service in death-penalty trials; and
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   disproportionate imposition of death sentences against defendants of
../dumps-text/en-40.txt:   color. The report provides compelling evidence of racial bias in the
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   modern death penalty, including:
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-     * A 2015 meta-analysis of 30 studies showed that the killers of white
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       people were more likely than the killers of Black people to face a
--
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-     * Exonerations of African Americans for murder convictions are 22
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       percent more likely to be linked to police misconduct.
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-
../dumps-text/en-40.txt:   The report highlights several pending death penalty cases where racial
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   discrimination played a role in driving death sentences for Black
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-   defendants. For example:
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-     * Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman, Tennessee. In 2019, Davidson County District
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       Attorney General Glenn Funk conceded that Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman's
../dumps-text/en-40.txt:       trial had been infected by overt racial bias. Abdur'Rahman had long
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       argued that the prosecutor struck two Black potential jurors based
../dumps-text/en-40.txt:       on racial stereotypes. The trial court agreed to a reduced
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       sentence, but the Tennessee Attorney General's Office is currently
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       appealing.
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-     * Julius Jones, Oklahoma. Julius Jones, who has a strong innocence
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       claim, was convicted and sentenced to death by a nearly all-white
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       jury for killing a white businessman. His case was riddled with
../dumps-text/en-40.txt:       racial discrimination, including an officer using a racial slur
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       during his arrest, prosecutors striking every Black potential juror
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       but one, and a juror who used the n-word to describe Jones. His
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       petition for clemency is currently pending.
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-     * Federal Death Penalty. Although the first set of executions
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       scheduled by the federal government in 2020 have been strategically
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       directed at white people, the federal death penalty has long been
../dumps-text/en-40.txt:       plagued by the same racial bias present in state death penalty
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       systems. Thirty-four of the 57 people currently on federal death
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       row are people of color, including 26 Black men. Some were
../dumps-text/en-40.txt-       convicted and condemned by all-white juries. In an action widely
