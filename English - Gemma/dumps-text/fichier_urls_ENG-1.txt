Stephen Miller-led group emerges as top legal foe of Biden initiatives

   Stephen Miller's law group says it's fighting 'racism against White
   people'

   CNN  —

   A conservative legal group led by former top Trump aide Stephen Miller
   has emerged as a frequent opponent to several Biden administration
   initiatives by mounting court challenges, succeeding in blocking
   policies they say are examples of reverse discrimination.

   Miller touts America First Legal as “the long-awaited answer to the
   (American Civil Liberties Union),” and his group has garnered several
   legal victories against the Biden administration in the past few weeks
   and months, most notably on issues of racial discrimination.

   The group has aired advertisements criticizing the Biden
   administration’s policies on LGBTQ rights and has filed a class-action
   lawsuit against Texas A&M University, claiming the college has “engaged
   in a discriminatory hiring practice, choosing which candidates to hire
   based on their race or sex.” That lawsuit is ongoing.

   In 2021, America First Legal was also successful in halting some
   Covid-19 relief funds under the Small Business Administration’s
   Restaurant Revitalization Fund to women, veterans and minority business
   owners who could apply for grants during a priority period in its
   initial rollout, a move Miller argued was an “unconstitutional and
   racially discriminatory scheme.”

   Perhaps most notably, the organization was involved in legal challenges
   that forced the Biden administration to create a work-around on getting
   debt relief for farmers of color. An effort passed as part of the
   Covid-19-related American Rescue Plan in 2021 was challenged in court
   by a litany of lawsuits by some White farmers who complained that the
   effort to remedy longstanding inequities by wiping the debt of only
   farmers of color was itself discriminatory.

   America First Legal filed a lawsuit against the effort, representing
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and a group of White farmers
   in the state who also argued that the program is unconstitutional
   because of racial discrimination. The lawsuits led to an injunction
   that blocked the debt relief payments.

   Attorneys argued that the USDA’s definition of “socially disadvantaged
   farmer and rancher” that excludes Whites is “patently
   unconstitutional.” They also said the agency was violating the
   Constitution by “discriminating on the grounds of race, color, and
   national origin” in the program and that the court should prohibit the
   clause from being enforced.

   Ultimately, the administration abandoned the effort and quietly tucked
   a couple provisions into the Inflation Reduction Act that passed over
   the summer to allocate debt relief that is eligible to farmers of all
   backgrounds, regardless of race.

   CNN has reached out to America First Legal for comment.

   Several Black farmers and social justice advocates have said Miller’s
   actions are harmful.

   “I want to set the record straight – no one is against White farmers in
   this country,” John Boyd Jr., 57, a fourth-generation farmer who is
   founder and president of the National Black Farmers Association, told
   CNN. He added that what Miller is doing to Black farmers through the
   legal challenges is “humiliating and the worst thing you can do for
   race-relations in this country.”

   Dorian Spence, a lawyer whose firm represented the Federation of
   Southern Cooperatives, a group of southern cooperatives that has been
   advocating for Black farmers in litigation brought by White farmers,
   told CNN that Miller’s group uses “grievance politics through the rule
   of law to try to exclude people of color broadly, but in certain
   pockets Black people specifically from areas of opportunity.”

   “America First sees an America that is increasingly White, White
   male-driven,” Spence said.
