Are Asian Americans victims of racism or beneficiaries of whiteness? It’s
complex.

It’s time to discard this simplistic dichotomy.

   A question that seems to be asked with increasing frequency is whether
   Asian Americans are the beneficiaries of privileges historically
   afforded to white people in the United States or if we are the victims
   of racial discrimination. But reality is much more complex. It’s time
   to discard this simplistic dichotomy.

   Take the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard case to be heard in
   the US Supreme Court in October. Plaintiffs in the case argue that
   Asian Americans experience racial discrimination in Harvard admissions,
   as evidenced, they claim, by admitted Asian American students’ higher
   GPAs and SAT scores compared to admitted students of all other races,
   including white students. They also point to admissions officers’ lower
   “personal” ratings of Asian American applicants compared to those of
   other students. Harvard and its defenders have responded in part by
   pointing to the increasing percentage of Asian Americans admitted every
   year. The university also points out that academics are not the only
   criterion they use to admit students.

   What both sides of this argument miss is the complexity of race in

   In 2019, federal Judge Allison Burroughs affirmed Harvard’s admissions
   practices as legally sound in her ruling but also recognized the
   possibility of anti-Asian discrimination in “personal” ratings. Asian
   Americans also experience glass ceilings in corporate firms and
   bullying in schools. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian
   Americans have experienced increased physical attacks. It’s clear that
   anti-Asian discrimination is real. A high percentage of Asian American
   students admitted to Harvard does not preclude the possibility of
   anti-Asian racism.

   On the other hand, Asian Americans’ overall high SAT scores and GPAs
   are driven, in part, by privileges made for and normally afforded to
   middle-class white Americans. Many Asian Americans have been able to
   benefit from these advantages. Why? US immigration policy has meant
   that a large proportion of immigrants from Asia come with college and
   even graduate degrees. High incomes enable a significant number of them
   to move to well-off suburbs historically designed as islands of
   privilege for upper-middle-class white people leaving integrated
   cities.

   Those municipalities have, for decades, been able to offer a top-notch
   public education — they can provide more opportunities given their high
   tax bases — and they have fewer poverty-related challenges to address,
   as well. Those advantages — along with highly skilled Asian parents’
   dexterity in educational testing (that’s what got them into top
   colleges in Asia) and positive stereotypes teachers often have about
   Asian Americans’ academic capability — facilitate Asian American kids’
   high levels of academic achievement. In this regard, Asian Americans do
   indeed benefit from “whiteness” as a system of advantage. In other
   words, the US education system has racially unequal opportunities and
   hence outcomes baked into it, and Asian Americans have actually
   benefited from that racial inequality that historically has privileged
   white students over Black and Latinx students.

   Taking this history into account when making admissions decisions means
   we’d expect Asian American and white students’ SAT scores and GPAs to
   be higher than those of Black, Latinx, and Native American students on
   average. Of course, Asian Americans are diverse, and working-class
   Asian Americans do not experience the benefits of living in well-off
   neighborhoods, even if some may benefit from teachers’ positive
   stereotypes about Asian Americans’ academic capabilities.

   I found these dual forces of race operating in my own research in a
   well-off East Coast suburb with a large and growing Asian American
   population. This was a town that, like many affluent suburbs around the
   country — from San Jose, Calif., to Weston, Mass. — had many years ago
   passed laws to prevent working-class people from moving in, such as
   minimum housing lot size requirements and limits on the building of
   multifamily homes. The historical record shows that laws like these and
   the choices many white Americans made (and continue to make) about
   where to live were frequently related to a desire to steer clear of
   Black people in particular. Many suburban properties even had explicit
   racially restrictive covenants, which barred the sale of those
   properties to Black buyers. These covenants were legal until the Fair
   Housing Act of 1968.

   Even today, Black middle-class professionals frequently do not choose
   to live in towns like the one I studied, in part because they
   understand the problems likely to ensue if their children do not have
   peers who share their racial identity. Racial steering by real estate
   agents also keeps them away.

   But Asian Americans have had a different experience in the United
   States. The history of residential segregation between Black and white
   Americans, ironically, enabled Asian American professionals to reap the
   benefits of living in communities segregated by class and previously by
   race. Some see evidence like this as meaning that Asian Americans are
   “white adjacent.”

   But in my research I also found evidence of anti-Asian racism. Many
   white parents expressed disdain for Asian American parenting, which,
   they observed, enabled Asian American students to outperform white
   students academically. For example, one white mom complained to me
   about the presence of kids whose parents had academic standards she
   deemed unreasonably high, describing one to me by saying, “her name is
   not Sally Smith. … It’s never the blonde Norwegian.”

   To be sure, anti-Asian American racism is not the same as anti-Black
   racism. The two are driven by different stereotypes and appear in
   different spheres of social life. There is no point in trying to
   measure whether one is “worse” than the other. They are different, and
   we must find ways for both to end.

   To do so, we must stop assuming that Asian American academic
   achievement means the end of anti-Asian racism or that Asian Americans
   sometimes benefiting from privileges previously reserved for white
   Americans means we always benefit from the privileges of whiteness. The
   multifaceted nature of racial discrimination and privilege in the
   United States is far more complex. To tackle it, we need to understand
   its diverse faces.
