   U.S. Statement at Debate on Racial Discrimination

   Debate on Racial Discrimination
   Midterm review of the International Decade for People of African
   Descent

   46th Session of the Human Rights Council
   March 12, 2021

   As Delivered by Charles Bentley

   Panelists, thank you for your presentations on this important issue.

   All across the world, including in the United States, we see young
   people raise their voices against the destructive legacy of racism.
   They have recognized that lack of access to jobs, education,
   healthcare, and opportunity does not happen in a vacuum.  Last summer,
   as protesters of all races, ages, and backgrounds in the United States
   and around the world raised their voices against the–all–too
   frequent occurrence of Black lives ending at the hands of law
   enforcement, we were reminded, yet again, that we must do more
   to address systemic racism.  What many people did not see, or simply
   refused to see, could not be ignored any longer.  The promise
   of “liberty and justice for all” has not been achieved.

   Young people have been at the frontline of this global movement against
   racism and racial discrimination.  Now more than ever, we see
   that youth engagement and political participation are vital to
   addressing systemic racism, as well as other global challenges,
   including climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and authoritarian
   threats to democracy.  It is essential that we commit to giving young
   people access to the political space and providing an enabling
   environment for them to be active citizens. 

   In his first weeks in office, President Biden established a
   whole-of-government process to assess and end systemic racism in
   government policy, programs, and institutions.  He signed executive
   actions to redress racially discriminatory federal housing policies and
   end the federal government’s use of private prisons, a first step
   towards addressing mass incarceration, which disproportionately
   impacts people of African descent and other people of color.  He also
   extended a pause on repaying student loans during the pandemic, which
   represent a disproportionate economic burden for people of color.
   These actions support young Americans, who President Biden praised for
   “pulling us toward justice in so many ways.”

   As we enter the second half of the International Decade for People of
   African Descent, the United States is committed to empowering and
   listening to youth voices as we work to ensure that equity and the
   fight against systemic racism drives policymaking.
