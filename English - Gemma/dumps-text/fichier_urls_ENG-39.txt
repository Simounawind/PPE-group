Young activists do not trust their Government on racial discrimination

   July 1, 2020

Research from One Young World’s global network shows that 74% of their Peace
Ambassadors do not believe racial discrimination will be changed by their
politicians

   New research from One Young World’s global network of the young leaders
   highlights how far we still are from achieving racial justice – with
   74% of its Peace Ambassadors stating they have no trust in their
   government to address the issue in the long-term.

   Reinforcing this lack of trust in existing leadership, the findings
   show that over half of the activists surveyed do not think their
   government will use the current civil rights movement to make
   meaningful progress in addressing racial discrimination.

   The survey was undertaken with One Young World’s Peace Ambassadors – a
   global network of young leaders on the front line of peace-building
   around the world supported by the European Commission and Dutch
   Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

What do young activists think about the world?

   An overwhelming majority of the young leaders surveyed do not have
   faith in the school system or the media (84% and 85% respectively) to
   educate and report on racial equality properly – highlighting the need
   for change across every corner of society to achieve real social
   justice.

   The findings also highlight effective means of change making and found
   two thirds of young leaders believe social media is the most important
   tool for activism in 2020.

   In the wake of sustained police brutality in the United States of
   America, the world has been forced to pay attention to racial
   injustice. With the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Elijah
   McClain, and countless others, a wide expanse of global society has
   been galvanised to what Barack Obama describes as an “awakening”. The
   perception of racism in the US is particularly evolving, with 59% of
   swing voters agreeing with the ideas of Black Lives Matter. The
   defunding of police as a federal conversation and possibility is
   currently derailed, due to the ongoing intel revelations concerning
   Russia and American soldiers.

   Currently, 1 in 4 of the young activists surveyed do not believe
   equality will be achieved in the next 5 years – and 1 in 5 do not
   believe we will ever achieve equality globally.

Who are the Peace Ambassadors?

   • Satta Sheriff, Liberia – Founder of Youth in Action for Peace and
   Empowerment, an NGO dedicated to defending and protecting the rights of
   Liberian children and vulnerable groups.
   • Achaleke Christian, Cameroon – Founder of Prisonpreneurs, a
   rapidly-expanding initiative that was established to counter one of the
   biggest causes of violent extremism: poverty and lack of economic
   opportunities.
   • Hyppolite Ntigurirwa, Rwanda – Hyppo witnessed his father’s murder
   during the Rwandan genocide at just seven years old, but has chosen to
   forgive the killers and dedicate his life to advocating for peace. His
   Be The Peace initiative promotes inter-ethnic friendships, working
   educate and unite the post-conflict generations in Rwanda.
   • Zar Li Aye, Myanmar – A human rights lawyer in Myanmar working to
   give people a fair trial in a system where 90 per cent of defendants
   are not allowed a lawyer.
   • Ahlem Nasraoui, Tunisia – A nominee of for the UN’s Intercultural
   Innovation Award, Ahlem is fighting the causes of terrorism in Tunisia
   through the Young Leaders Entrepreneurs – a nationwide campaign
   promoting the economic empowerment of at-risk young people.

   Ella Robertson, Managing Director of One Young World, said:

   “In the past month, we have seen racial injustices brought into the
   spotlight as people globally call for action on inequality.

   “At One Young World, we believe that at the heart of every global
   threat is a failure of leadership and the findings in this recent
   research from our Peace Ambassadors reinforce just that. We are proud
   of our global network of young leaders working hard to create a better
   world – with more responsible, and more effective leadership.

   The continued support of One Young World peace programmes supported by
   the European Commission and Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs mean we
   can connect leading activists around the world who are all changing
   their community, and the world, for the better.
