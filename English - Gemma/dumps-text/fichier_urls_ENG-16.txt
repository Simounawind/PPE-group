   Summary.

   Many white Americans believe that race is no longer central to one’s
   opportunities in life, and that we’re well on our way to systemic
   racial equality. Are these beliefs accurate? While it’s often difficult
   to measure levels of discrimination over time, research into hiring
   discrimination shows that black Americans still face discrimination in
   the hiring process. A meta-analysis of callback rates from all existing
   field experiments (24 total, including data from more than 54,000
   applications across more than 25,000 positions) showed evidence of
   discrimination against both black and Latino applicants. Since 1990
   white applicants received, on average, 36% more callbacks than black
   applicants and 24% more callbacks than Latino applicants with otherwise
   identical résumés. When it comes to Latinos, there is some evidence of
   a decline in discrimination over the past 25 years. Due to the small
   number of field experiments including Latinos, statistical tests
   indicate the evidence of decline is inconclusive. For blacks, however,
   researchers found no change in hiring rates over time.

   Race is often at the forefront of American conversation. It has lately
   emerged with new urgency around discussions of policing, immigration,
   First Amendment rights, and even professional football. And yet even as
   we are confronted with dramatic examples of ongoing racial tensions,
   most white Americans remain convinced that race is no longer central to
   one’s opportunities in life. Polling data shows that many believe these
   lingering conflicts represent the actions of a few bad apples and
   aren’t in sync with the larger trend toward systemic racial equality.

   Are these beliefs accurate? What do we know about long-term trends in
   racial discrimination?

   Discrimination, given how it often manifests subtly, is notoriously
   difficult to measure in any context. And until recently we have not had
   much information that we could use to reliably assess changes in
   discrimination over time. However, in our recent study, published in
   the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we were able to
   analyze trends in discrimination by performing a meta-analysis from all
   available field experiments pertaining to one area: racial
   discrimination in hiring. We focused on experiments performed since
   1990, when field studies became more numerous and their
   methodologically improved. We analyzed data from 24 field experiments,
   which included data from more than 54,000 applications across more than
   25,000 positions.

   We chose field experiments as a sample because they are widely regarded
   as the most valid method to assess discrimination. They generally come
   in two major types: Résumé audits, done through the mail or online,
   submit fictitious résumés with equivalent qualifications and ethnically
   identifiable names. And in-person audits — done with trained pairs of
   testers, white and nonwhite — have participants apply for jobs. By
   examining the rates of callbacks, or invitations to job interviews, for
   white and nonwhite applicants with equivalent qualifications, these
   studies provide high-quality measures of rates of discrimination in
   hiring.

   Broadly, our meta-analysis of callback rates from all existing field
   experiments showed evidence of discrimination against both black and
   Latino applicants. Since 1990 white applicants received, on average,
   36% more callbacks than black applicants and 24% more callbacks than
   Latino applicants with identical résumés.

   When it comes to Latinos, we found some evidence of a decline in
   discrimination over the past 25 years. Because of the small number of
   field experiments including Latinos, however, statistical tests
   indicate the evidence of decline is inconclusive.

   For black applicants we found no change in hiring rates over time. In
   the figure below, the dots represent results from 21 studies
   contrasting white and black applicants, based on a total of 42,708
   applications for 20,990 positions. The line shows the overall trend.
   The line slants slightly upward, but it’s statistically
   indistinguishable from a flat line.

   We wondered if this level of discrimination might be influenced by
   applicant education, applicant gender, study method, occupational
   groups, and local labor market conditions. When we controlled for these
   factors, we found that none account for the trend in discrimination.
   Under these and other adjustments, our results suggest that levels of
   discrimination against black job applicants hasn’t changed since 1990.

   Our results do not address the possibility that hiring discrimination
   may have substantially dropped in the 1960s or early 1970s, during the
   civil rights era, when many forms of direct discrimination were
   outlawed. Further, our results pertain only to discrimination at the
   point of hire, not at later points in the employment relationship, such
   as wage setting or promotion decisions. It may be the case, then, that
   meaningful reductions in discrimination have taken place at other
   points in the employment relationship. What our results do point to is
   that at the initial point of entry — hiring decisions — blacks remain
   substantially disadvantaged relative to equally qualified whites, and
   we see little indication of progress over time.

   What might account for the stubborn persistence of hiring
   discrimination? At first glance, our findings seem to contradict other
   trends. Attitude surveys indicate that overtly prejudicial beliefs have
   declined, and endorsement of the principles of equal treatment
   regardless of race has increased. Americans appear to have become more
   concerned with diversity and inclusion and, in a small number of elite
   firms, affirmative action practices have made meaningful changes in the
   opportunities available to racial minorities.

   At the same time, however, assessments of subtle forms of racial
   stereotypes and measures of unconscious bias have shown little change
   over time. The vast majority of hiring is subject to very little
   oversight, and compensatory policies that address racial bias reach a
   very small fraction of hiring overall. Together, these trends offer
   little support for optimism about racial progress in the United States.
   While some people may assume that discrimination has declined over
   time, through increasing diversity in institutions along with other
   cultural changes, it seems as though, at least in terms of hiring, this
   expectation doesn’t meet with reality.

   We believe that our results provide a strong rationale for affirmative
   action policies and point to the continuing need for the enforcement of
   antidiscrimination legislation. Even among well-intended employers,
   racial bias may lurk in hiring decisions. Whether conscious or not,
   bias continues to affect decision making, and we find little evidence
   that this pattern will diminish on its own. Instead, more active
   intervention may be needed to reduce discrimination at the point of
   hire.
