Students demand action after reports of racist Snapchat post

December 14, 2022

   By Mercy Austin and Scout Hudson

Update: On Dec. 14, Mizzou Students for Life told The Maneater that Megan
Miller is no longer a member of its executive board as of Dec. 8 with the
following statement:

“Mizzou SFL believes all life is valuable and rejects prejudice against
people based on age, sex, race, stage of development, perceptions of
abilities, or income.”

   On Dec. 7, a screenshot was posted in a group chat between many Black
   students on the MU campus.  The screenshot displayed an alleged
   Snapchat post of MU student Megan Miller using a racial slur and
   promoting violence toward Black people, and it quickly circulated via
   social media. It is unknown when the post was originally created.

   According to Miller’s LinkedIn, which has since been deleted, she
   served as the president of the MU chapter of Turning Point USA but
   resigned “without explanation” last week, as reported to The Kansas
   City Star from the national branch of Turning Point USA.

   In the same correspondence with the Kansas City Star, TPUSA stated,
   “this kind of language has no place at TPUSA, and we support her
   decision to remove herself from all involvement with that local
   chapter.”

   Miller also acted as the vice president of public relations for Mizzou
   Students for Life. It is unclear whether Miller will continue to serve
   in that position, as MUSFL has not responded to The Maneater’s request
   for comment.

   Jeremiah Jordan, the executive adviser of the Black Collegiate Network,
   said it was disheartening to see the post, especially coming from a
   student who had executive positions on campus.

   “A lot of us want to call Mizzou home,” Jordan said. “A lot of us have
   our best friends here and have met many great people here. But then
   there’s the flip side of that — we have so much racism and so much hate
   speech spewed all over campus at all times. It’s scary to think about
   all these people going around hating, hating us for our color and for
   literally no reason at all. They don’t even know who we are.”

   Jordan frequently witnesses what he describes as routine acts of racism
   on campus, with some of these incidents having affected him firsthand.

   “A lot of the experiences I’ve had deal with microaggressions, like
   people trying to touch my braids,” Jordan said.

   According to Jordan, many people on the MU campus have had similar
   experiences.  In 2020, many Black students shared their experiences
   with racism and microaggressions on campus through the hashtag
   #blackatmizzou.

   “It’s gross to think that it’s a normal occurrence at Mizzou,” Jordan
   said.

   Additional screenshots from Miller’s now-deleted Instagram page show
   her at a Turning Point USA conference standing with Kyle Rittenhouse,
   who shot three men on Oct. 25, 2020 at a Black Lives Matter protest in
   Kenosha, Wisconsin.

   “[The post] made me really uncomfortable, especially because the
   caption was something like ‘best day of my life’,” said Kaylyn Walker,
   who serves as a Senator with the Legion of Black Collegians.  “It was
   really uncomfortable for me, especially as a person of color.”

   Miller’s post is currently under review by the Office of Institutional
   Equity, according to MU News Bureau Director Christian Basi. As
   explained by Basi, the process entails contacting all involved
   individuals and investigating the context of the post.

   An MU press release condemned the post and said that following the
   review, the university will take immediate action.

   “The language is reprehensible, and we condemn any language and actions
   that are racist, discriminatory, and hateful to our community,” UM
   System President and MU Chancellor Mun Choi said.

   Some students have expressed concern that the report will eventually be
   dismissed.

   “I have friends that have filed reports [to the Office of Institutional
   Equity] and it has not been taken seriously. No type of realistic
   action has been taken,” said Walker. “I know a lot of people who have
   been in that situation and don’t really feel like going through the
   process just to be disappointed once again.”

   Miller’s post comes after another instance of white supremacist
   displays on MU’s campus earlier this semester.

   On Oct. 24, posters were put up around campus displaying white
   supremacist rhetoric and using the “14 words,” a known dog whistle
   within white supremacist spaces. The posters also included links to a
   white power website.

   In response to the posters, students formed Mizzou Fails, a coalition
   that presented a three-tiered list of demands to the administration.
   Upper-tier demands advocated for the diversification of MU faculty and
   other infrastructural changes. Tier-one demands called for MU to launch
   an investigation into the posters, to punish the individuals
   responsible for their creation and distribution, and finally, for Choi
   to issue a statement denouncing white supremacy and apologize to
   students for not acting sooner.

   On Nov. 10, Choi responded with an email condemning racism and
   discrimination, but there was no direct acknowledgment of the posters
   nor explicit condemnation of the content they promoted.

   The MU Faculty Council, an elected representative organization of MU
   professors, released a statement on Nov. 10 in which it condemned the
   content of the posters and acknowledged that the messages were
   inconsistent with MU’s values.

   According to the statement, “While posting the flyers may not violate
   university policies on free speech, it is important to acknowledge that
   the flyers display messages of hate, which have been associated with a
   history of racist violence in the U.S.”

   Four days later, a protest organized by MU students Alana Hayes and
   MarKeia “Nova” Kellogg was held in Speakers Circle to urge MU to
   formally condemn white supremacy and to take preventative measures
   against racial discrimination on campus.

   The MU administration did not issue any statements condemning white
   supremacy or the posters as demanded by protestors.

   “This isn’t one and done – there’s work that needs to be done on this
   campus,” Walker said.

   Walker believes combined momentum from recent protests and the outrage
   from Miller’s post can aid in creating a positive change on campus, but
   knows momentum alone isn’t enough. Walker said MU needs to focus on
   diversifying its faculty and executive board. According to data from MU
   Analytics, as of 2021, 4.13% of tenured MU faculty were identified
   Black.

   “A lot of people don’t feel the comfort that they need to go to faculty
   or staff about these situations, because a lot of times they don’t have
   a Black professor, or a Black dean, or a Black ambassador, or
   anything,” Walker said.

   Calls for a more diverse faculty were present in Mizzou Fails’
   upper-tier demands as well as the demands issued in 2015 by Concerned
   Student 1950, a student organization formed in 2015 after a string of
   racist incidents on MU’s campus. CS1950’s demands called for a series
   of administrative efforts aimed toward a more equitable campus — most
   notably the removal of then-UM System President Tim Wolfe.

   The demands were delivered in tandem with protests, including a hunger
   strike by MU student Jonathan Butler, a refusal to play by MU’s
   football team, and mass sit-ins and boycotts by students.

   CS1950 founding member Maxwell Little believes few strides have been
   made following the 2015 efforts.

   “It depends on how you measure change and how you look at what’s
   changed,” Little said. “From a structural and institutional perspective
   — no, there hasn’t been change when you look at the list of demands
   that [CS1950] had.”

   According to Little, Miller’s action reflects poorly on the
   university’s progress.

   “Hate speech impacts not just the students but the campus as a whole,”
   Little said. “MU has been trying to rebuild its brand since 2015.  So
   if they are in the rebuilding of the brand, they should take immediate
   action to make sure nothing like this continues to happen.”

   As the committee reviews Miller’s case, many are calling for MU to take
   actionable steps to prevent future incidents. Students hope to see
   Miller’s immediate removal from leadership in MU’s Students for Life
   following her resignation from MU’s Turning Point USA.

   “Forcing her to step down from leadership positions would send a
   message to other racists on campus … it would show them that their
   actions have consequences,” Jordan said.

   Additionally, many feel that expulsion from MU is necessary.

   “[Expulsion] is a very serious thing, but when she’s making a comment
   about African Americans, I really do think that is a very serious
   action that needs a very serious consequence,” Walker said.

   In addition to consequences for Miller, Walker said she wants to see
   intentionality and transparency within the MU administration.

   “I feel like more than anything, just a personal email, that’s not
   auto-generated and is coming from a person who’s actively investigating
   this case, would be really helpful to know exactly how the institution
   is handling this situation,” Walker said. “So we know they’re not
   putting it aside and just saying they’re investigating the case.”

   As the investigation continues, Walker hopes Miller’s case committee
   takes the proper steps to address and prevent acts of racism at MU.
   She asks, “What are you doing to actively combat racism, prejudice, and
   microaggression on this campus, not just when there are specific
   instances, but every single day? Where do your priorities lie when it
   comes to racism and prejudice on this campus?”
