UN’s Bachelet hails ‘millions of voices’ tackling racial discrimination

   28 March 2022 Human Rights

   More than two decades after the signing of the Durban Declaration and
   Programme of Action (PoA) – the UN’s blueprint to tackle racism and
   other forms of discrimination –UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
   Michelle Bachelet on Monday, hailed the “millions of voices around the
   globe” who’ve made it their mission to eradicate the scourge, while
   also noting that more work needs to be done.

   In paying tributed to those who “relentlessly – and courageously –
   fight racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related
   intolerance,” she outlined to the Human Rights Council that progress
   was being made.

   “Powerful global movements against racism are shifting the status quo”,
   the UN right chief said, pointing to the “worldwide protests against
   racism and racial discrimination” prompted by the murder of George
   Floyd in 2020, as a “testimony to the power of people and solidarity.”

More work needed

   In confronting the immense racism and discrimination that deeply
   permeate social structures and institutions, she noted that brave
   defenders are often met with “xenophobia and hate speech…[and]
   countless obstacles”.

   Moreover, their skin colour, ethnic affiliation, religious beliefs, or
   birthplace endanger their own lives, the senior UN official continued.

   While welcoming the “considerable efforts” of rights defenders and
   encouraged by their progress, she acknowledged that millions continue
   to be threatened by racism.

   “Africans and people of African descent, Asians and people of Asian
   descent, indigenous peoples, migrants, and national, ethnic and
   linguistic minorities, continue to be confronted by racism, racial
   discrimination, inequality and exclusion.

   “This can often take the form of Islamophobia, antisemitism, religious
   discrimination and intolerance, affecting Muslim, Arab, Jewish and
   other communities around the world”.

Dangerous narratives

   Meanwhile, harmful narratives continue to thrive against migrants and
   refugees, evoking fear and racial superiority while fuelling racial
   discrimination, hatred and violence.

   “This hatred is often fed by political discourse, or by the media”, the
   High Commissioner explained, saying that “toxic narratives destroy our
   social fabric…[and] destabilize our common values.”

   She said that in times of peace as well as in conflict, authorities,
   politicians and the private sector bear “special responsibility” not to
   incite hatred, discrimination and violence, including in online.

   “All manifestations of racism must be immediately addressed and
   stopped”.

Pick up the pace

   “We are moving too slowly,” Ms. Bachelet told the meeting. “It is vital
   – and urgent – that we unite to accelerate the pace in the fight
   against racism and racial discrimination”.

   Noting that the Durban PoA remains “more relevant than ever” in this
   fight, she underscored that States also need to honour their
   obligations and use international instruments to devise laws and
   policies that speak to racism and racial discrimination.

   “The newly established Permanent Forum of People of African Descent
   will soon start operating and advise this Council on matters related to
   people of African descent,” the High Commissioner said.

   It will also contribute to the drawing up of a UN declaration on
   promoting, protecting and fully respecting the human rights of people
   of African descent.

   She said that her office, OHCHR’s, Four-point Agenda Towards
   Transformative Change for Racial Justice and Equality also provides a
   “number of important recommendations and a clear path for action.”

Deliver reparatory justice

   The UN rights chief pushed for States to listen to those being
   discriminated against, stand up against racism in all its forms, and
   act on their concerns.

   “This cannot be a purely tokenistic effort,” she said, describing as a
   “fundamental step” that activists and communities have meaningful,
   effective participation and representation “at all levels of
   decision-making” in the fight against racial discrimination.

   Furthermore, she continued, States and societies must address the
   legacy and consequences of racism and exclusion, including colonial
   exploitation, enslavement and the trade in enslaved Africans.

     It is time to deliver reparatory justice – UN rights chief

   “These crimes affected generations of women, men and children,
   stripping them of their humanity,” Ms. Bachelet said, adding that “it
   is time to deliver reparatory justice”.

Strength of diversity

   Only by embracing our differences can progress towards real change be
   made.

   “The International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination is
   observed to remind us of the horrors which racial discrimination can
   cause,” she told the participants.

   Observing that “collective action is powerful action,” she urged
   everyone to stand in solidarity with all victims.

   “Together, let’s raise our voice and stand up against racism,” the High
   Commissioner concluded. "Never again".
