For equality, respect and dignity we must ‘speak as one’ against racism:
Guterres

   18 March 2022 Human Rights

   Racism continues to poison institutions, social structures, and
   everyday life across all societies, the UN chief said on Friday at a
   dedicated meeting against what he referred to as a catalyst that
   “normalizes hate, denies dignity, and spurs violence”.

   “It continues to be a driver of persistent inequality…to deny people
   their fundamental human rights”, added Secretary-General António
   Guterres in an address to the General Assembly, marking the
   International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

   He argued that racism destabilizes communities worldwide, “undermines
   democracies, erodes the legitimacy of governments, and stymies an
   inclusive and sustainable recovery from COVID-19.”

   Commemorated annually on 21 March, he described the day as “both a day
   of recognition and an urgent call to action”.

Unequivocal links

   The top UN official drew attention to the links between racism and
   gender inequality, pointing to overlapping and intersecting
   discrimination suffered by women of colour and minority groups.

   Moreover, he continued, “no country is immune from intolerance, nor
   free of hate.”

   “Africans and people of African descent, Asians and people of Asian
   descent, minority communities, indigenous peoples, migrants, refugees,
   and so many others – all continue to confront stigmatization,
   scapegoating, discrimination, and violence”.

‘Bedrock’ of societies

   This year’s theme – “Voices for Action against Racism” – calls on
   everyone to listen closely, speak out loudly, and act decisively.

   “We all have a responsibility to engage in solidarity with movements
   for equality and human rights everywhere. And we must extend solidarity
   to everyone fleeing conflict,” said the UN chief, urging the world to
   “speak out against hate speech – offline and online.”

   He upheld the need to defend civic space by protecting free expression
   and assembly, describing it is “the bedrock of pluralist, peaceful and
   inclusive societies”.

‘Dismantle discriminatory structures’

   Mr. Guterres called for a rights-based social contract “to tackle
   poverty and exclusion, invest in education, and rebuild trust and
   social cohesion.”

   “We must listen to those experiencing injustice and ensure their
   concerns and demands are at the centre of efforts to dismantle
   discriminatory structures,” he insisted.

   He made a case for “reparatory justice” to realize racial equality and
   atone in a substantive way for centuries of enslavement and
   colonialism.

   “Historical injustices manifest themselves in poverty,
   underdevelopment, marginalization, and social instability for entire
   communities and countries,” he reminded. “It is time to recognize and
   repair longstanding wrongs”.

     It is time to recognize and repair longstanding wrongs -- UN chief

Repairing the past

   A just future, requires mending a discriminatory past, in line with
   international human rights obligations and commitments, he said.

   The UN chief encouraged States to accelerate racial justice and
   equality through the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action; the
   International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
   Discrimination; the Agenda Towards Transformative Change for Racial
   Justice and Equality; and the UN’s Permanent Forum of People of African
   Descent.

   He called for concrete action through policies, legislation, and “more
   granular data collection” to support efforts at national and global
   levels.

   The UN has launched its own internal strategic action plan on
   addressing racism, he reminded, that outlines concrete measures to
   tackle racism in the workplace through accountability – for which a
   Special Adviser and Steering Group are due to be appointed.
   Stop Racism

   “Together, we are committed to making sure people of every race,
   ethnicity, colour, gender, religion, creed and sexual orientation,
   enjoy a sense of belonging and safety, and have an equal opportunity to
   contribute to the success of our United Nations,” he stated

   Action every day, at every level, in every society is demanded to
   achieve a world free of racism and racial discrimination.
   “Let us unite around our common humanity and speak as one for equality,
   respect, justice and dignity for all,” concluded the UN chief.

Paying tribute to Ukraine

   Hosting the event, General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid, began by
   expressing his “deepest concerns” over the violence waged against
   civilians, and particularly women and girls, in Ukraine.

   As families continue to seek refuge and security in new locations, he
   said, “our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine.”

A goal not realized

   Since the day was established more than half a century ago, the
   elimination of racial discrimination has continued to elude us, Mr.
   Shahid reminded the participants.

   Despite that the International Convention has reached near universal
   ratification, he observed, “we continue to see an increase in hate
   speech, intolerance, and racism, especially against minorities.”

   “Our moral failure to eliminate racial discrimination is a failure
   against everything we stand for in the Hall of this Assembly”, he
   declared.

‘Overt stereotyping’

   The Assembly President drew attention to the long-lasting consequences
   of racial discrimination, noting that the COVID pandemic has served to
   exacerbate underlying and long-standing inequalities that plague
   societies at large, including racism, racial discrimination,
   xenophobia, and other forms of intolerance.

   Many marginalized and vulnerable people have lost decades of precious
   gains, especially in their social, economic, civil, and political
   lives, he said.

     We have a moral obligation to tackle racism in all its forms -- UN
     Assembly President

   “Let me be clear: Racial discrimination is an overt stereotyping and
   prejudice that arises from hate speech and hate propaganda,” Mr. Shahid
   spelled out.

A moral obligation

   Rather than acknowledging the beauty of diversity, he maintained that
   racism gives birth to violence and strengthens inequalities.

   “We can and we must do better,” said the Assembly president. “We have a
   moral obligation to tackle racism in all its forms.”

   Going forward, he encouraged national governments, civil society
   organizations, and the private sector to “work together to eliminate
   racial discrimination.”
