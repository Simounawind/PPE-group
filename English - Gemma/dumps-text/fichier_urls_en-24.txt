State civil rights department files more racial discrimination charges
against Grand Rapids police

   The Michigan Department of Civil Rights has filed more charges of
   racial discrimination against the Grand Rapids Police Department.

   The charges announced Thursday are over an incident that happened in
   the city in 2018, when GRPD stopped a group of three Black boys and
   held them at gunpoint, based on a call that the boys had a toy gun.

   “There was no initial crime reported,” said MDCR director John E.
   Johnson Jr. “There’s nothing illegal about two children walking near
   train tracks with what the 911 caller identified repeatedly as a toy
   gun.”

   Johnson said GRPD couldn’t provide any evidence of white children ever
   receiving the same treatment. The formal civil rights charges against
   the department only involve the treatment of the two 11-year-old boys
   stopped during the incident. The MDCR says it didn’t receive a
   complaint about the 17-year-old who was stopped with them.

   The MDCR says it currently has 21 open investigations of alleged civil
   rights abuses by the GRPD — more than twice as many open civil rights
   investigations as any other police department in the state. The next
   highest number is for Detroit police, with eight open investigations
   against it, then Lansing, with six, according to a civil rights
   department spokesperson.

   The spokesperson said the department currently has a total of 119 open
   civil rights investigations involving police departments in Michigan.

   The number of open investigations of alleged abuses involving GRPD
   includes two cases that led to formal charges filed this summer.

   All of the formal charges announced by the MDCR are submitted to an
   administrative law judge, who decides whether to issue fines against
   the police department, and possibly force the department to take steps
   to correct its practices.

   “We are aware of today’s announcement by the MDCR," said a city
   spokesperson in response to a request for comment from Michigan Radio.
   "We have not yet been served with the charges. We’ll be reviewing the
   charges and responding appropriately.”

   Residents in Grand Rapids have complained for years about how the Grand
   Rapids police department treats its non-white residents. A 2017 report
   commissioned by the city showed that Black drivers were twice as likely
   to be stopped as white drivers. And there have been a series of high
   profile incidents involving how GRPD treats children during stops. Two
   of those incidents are now part of the formal charges against the
   department.

   The civil rights department held two public listening sessions in the
   city in 2019 to hear residents' claims about the police department.
   Johnson said more than 80 people spoke at the hearings, and dozens more
   filed complaints with the civil rights department.

   The formal charges announced Thursday come a week after the city was
   hit with a $100 million civil lawsuit that alleges racial
   discrimination in the killing of Patrick Lyoya. A Grand Rapids police
   officer shot and killed Lyoya following a traffic stop in April. Lyoya
   was Black and had no weapon when he was stopped.

   And earlier this month, Grand Rapids city commissioners approved paying
   more than $300,000 to settle a lawsuit over the police department
   violating the civil rights of two Black men it stopped in 2011. Police
   took photos and fingerprints of the two men, Denishio Johnson and Keyon
   Harrison, after stopping them — though neither was accused of any
   crime. The Michigan Supreme Court ruled this year that the policy of
   photographing and fingerprinting innocent people violated the Fourth
   Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

   The ACLU of Michigan said 75% of the people GRPD photographed and
   fingerprinted under the policy were Black.

   On December 6, Grand Rapids City Commissioners agreed to settle the
   11-year old lawsuit by paying Harrison and Johnson $30,000 each, and
   paying the ACLU of Michigan $270,000 in legal fees.
