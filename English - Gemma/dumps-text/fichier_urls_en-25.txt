   very natural for the people to see other races as unworthy and down.
   Many Indians have also faced a lot of problems in the past due to the
   racial abuse. The people do not get promotions in their jobs and they
   do not get equal salary as their white counterparts. Some are even
   subjected to violence. Lot of Indian Sikhs have been murdered and at
   the receiving end of physical abuse in the USA.
