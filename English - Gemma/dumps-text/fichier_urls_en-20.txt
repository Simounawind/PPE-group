Education is key to deconstruct racial narratives

   [racialdiscrimination_web688x358_en.jpg?itok=-kMcBm6f]
   © UNESCO / Olivier Marie
   23 March 2018
   Last update: 21 April 2022

   The role of education at all social levels and in particular of young
   generations, remains one of the best ways to stop the proliferation of
   racist and discriminatory discourses and to foster intercultural
   exchanges. This is the message of experts who gathered on 21 March at
   UNESCO in Paris for a Round table on Deconstructing racial narratives:
   challenging assumptions and fostering diversity, organized in the
   context of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial
   Discrimination.

   The event started with a presentation by Evelyne Heyer, Professor of
   the National Museum of Natural History of France, who explained the
   scientific evidence against the notion of race, which has resulted in
   practices ranging from discrimination to extermination of “the other”
   throughout history.

   “Races do not exist in the sense we thought in the 19th century, but
   even if the word ‘race’ is removed, racism will continue to exist. The
   term ‘race’ has a history, so we need to use this concept, if only to
   deconstruct it,” said Heyer.

   According to the professor, the DNA of all human beings is 99.9%
   identical, and we all are of African origin, dating back 100,000 years.
   With only 0.1% of differences in the genomes of people from across the
   world, the notion of race is not justifiable, she says.

   “Racism is not just about skin color, but about discrimination against
   individuals who are physically, culturally or morally different,” Heyer
   explained, adding that our genetic diversity is the result of
   adaptations to environments and our geographical origins.
   Three key components are at the basis of the definition of racism:
   categorization, hierarchization and essentialization. Categorization is
   a mental operation that simplifies the world. People classify
   individuals based on their appearance, their religion, their
   geographical origin, etc. Hierarchization involves a value judgment
   based on regarding one group or category of individuals as being
   superior or inferior to another. Essentialization is a process by which
   individuals are reduced to moral characteristics, intellectual
   faculties or psychological traits alleged to be an immutable and
   inherited feature of that particular group.

   Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of
   Indigenous Peoples, described racism from the perspective of indigenous
   communities and movements.

   “Indigenous peoples have experienced racism and discrimination since
   colonization. Racism was used deliberately to make them feel inferior
   and to take the resources from their lands. The strategy was to make
   them forget who they are,” she said. “The good news is that indigenous
   peoples are waking up, asserting their identities, and using the legal
   framework to protect their lands and fight against discrimination.”

   For Rita Izsák-Ndiaye, expert member of the Committee on the
   Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the fight against racial
   discrimination starts at home, in our own families: “I am a white Roman
   Christian and my husband is a Black Muslim. When I look at my family, I
   see that, because of love and being bound by the same values, we can
   deal with intercultural and interreligious tensions.”

   Noting the spread of hateful messages and the reinforcement of
   stereotypes through social media, Izsák-Ndiaye says it is necessary to
   stimulate constructive debates. “We cannot remain quiet in the face of
   hatred. We need a critical mass of anti-racist people active on social
   media fighting against the wrong discourses,” she commented. “Everyone
   owns society. Education, arts, music, literature and science need to
   include everyone.”

   At the end of the panel, the discussants agreed that the only way to
   fight racism is through education and action. “At the early stages of
   education, children need to be taught that they should look at others
   as equal to them. Promoting intercultural exchanges is crucial for the
   education system to build more harmonious societies,” said
   Tauli-Corpuz.

   The event was followed by the inauguration of the abridged version of
   the travelling exhibition “Us and Them – From Prejudice to Racism” with
   welcoming remarks from André Delpuech, Director of the Musée de
   l’Homme. It offers a journey that deciphers the reasons for racist and
   discriminatory behavior during certain moments of history and sheds
   light on racist behavior and prejudices. Conceived by the National
   Museum of Natural History of France, and shown at the Musée de l’Homme
   from March 2017 to January 2018 under the patronage of UNESCO, the
   exhibition will travel to different member cities of UNESCO’s
   International Coalition of Inclusive and Sustainable Cities – ICCAR.
