Psychology undergraduate aims to better understand the role of discrimination
in sleep

Crystal Li conducts research on minority populations and the transition to
college
     __________________________________________________________________

   December 19, 2022

   Crystal Li, an Arizona State University undergraduate psychology major
   with a minor in Spanish, hopes to make a difference in diverse
   communities through graduate research.

   When she was in high school, she volunteered in an underserved
   community in the San Francisco Bay Area that had just been hit with a
   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid for undocumented
   immigrants. Her internship gave her firsthand experience with the
   impact that research and interventions can have on the youth in the
   community. She conducted research with the students, and from that
   point on, she knew that she wanted to pursue psychology research.

   “The first lab that I joined was the Adolescent Stress and Emotion Lab
   with Professor Leah Doane. I've been in that lab for almost two years
   now, and the other lab that I'm a part of is the Arizona Twin Project
   with professors Mary Davis and Kathryn Lemery-Chalfant,” Li said.
   “Coming into college, I really didn't know what specifically my
   research interests were, but all I knew was that I really wanted to
   prioritize working in a lab that worked with diverse populations.”

   The Adolescent Stress and Emotion Lab conducts research on child and
   adolescent well-being using physiological, psychological and contextual
   factors with a particular focus on stress.

   “We focus on understanding daily experiences, physiology and sleep in
   the prediction of health and academic trajectories, as well as how
   transactions between culture and neurobiological systems may influence
   these pathways across development,” Doane said.

   While conducting research in the lab, Li was mentored by graduate
   student Jeri Sasser, a graduate mentor in the ASU ENERGIZE project,
   which guides underrepresented students in psychology and neuroscience
   to streamline the process of conducting research to prepare for
   graduate school. This mentorship encouraged Li to also give back as an
   undergraduate mentor in the program.

   “I'm currently an ENERGIZE peer mentor. This means that I mentor
   students about labs and connect them to resources, as well as check in
   and see how everything's going. I think that's really a nice little
   thing to do because Jeri was that person for me when I joined the
   Adolescent Stress and Emotion Lab. Mentorship is so important to
   inspire students to continue pursuing research and to believe that they
   have a place in research,” Li said.

   Li is currently applying to doctoral programs for developmental
   psychology. Her future research interests are in studying culture,
   sleep and stress, and academics and their role in development among
   ethnic, racial and minority youth.

   This fall, Li also defended her honors thesis as part of the psychology
   honors seminar on the relationship between ethnic racial discrimination
   and both objective and subjective measures of sleep among Latino
   students in their transition to college.

   “I presented to my classmates as well as my thesis committee, which was
   Dr. Doane, Dr. Jinni Su, Dr. Thao Ha and Jeri Sasser,” Li said. “It was
   such a wonderful experience, but I’m so glad it is over now! I spent
   over a year and a half on the project, and to see it through to
   completion was extremely validating.”

   Li’s advice to other students who are scared of pursuing research? Just
   go for it.

   “I was very scared to join a lab because I had no idea what to expect
   and I didn't know if I was well-suited for that kind of environment.
   Research can be really daunting for students – that's why I really
   appreciate what ENERGIZE is doing, and I wish I'd known about it when I
   was initially applying to labs,” Li said.

   “Something that I'm really interested in looking at is continuing my
   investigation of my honors thesis on discrimination in sleep and
   further exploring protective factors that can help protect you from
   harmful effects of discrimination,” Li said. “Transitioning into higher
   education is difficult for many people, and when you add in any kind of
   race-based stressor, that can be a huge barrier.”

   The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication fall
   2022 convocation ceremony celebrated the accomplishments of almost 340
   graduates while also serving as a homecoming for one of its most
   supportive and successful alumni.

   Christine Devine, an Arizona State University trustee and Cronkite
   Alumni Hall of Fame inductee, delivered the keynote address at the
   ceremony held on Wednesday, Dec. 14, at Desert Financial Arena in
   Tempe. Students wearing maroon and gold caps and gowns, smiling widley

   Devine is an award-winning television news anchor with Fox 11 Los
   Angeles, where she has worked for more than 30 years, and an active
   Cronkite School alumna who generously supports the school and ASU. In
   2007, she endowed the Christine Devine Scholarship, which provides
   scholarship support each year to students in the Cronkite School.

   In her convocation speech, Devine reflected on her journey that started
   as a Cronkite student in the 1980s and took her through a couple of
   small and medium media markets before landing in Los Angeles in 1990.

   Devine, who grew up in Tolleson, Arizona, the Phoenix area’s West
   Valley, began her broadcasting career working as a reporter in San
   Angelo, Texas. She credited former ASU journalism professor Ben Silver
   with helping her find the job after he posted her resume on a board at
   a news directors conference.

   “I’d go to McDonald’s and I would order a cheeseburger and water. I had
   no money,” she said. “But that job would lead me to say we don’t do
   this for the money. We do it for the passion of wanting to be a part of
   the ever-changing world. To not sit on the sidelines, but to be in the
   game.”

   Devine emphasized that life was about to change for the graduates as
   they were about to enter their careers, but she encouraged them to
   learn from their mistakes and celebrate their successes.

   “So there will be fewer football games, Friday night parties, the
   camaraderie you all have here. It is all the real world, to which I say
   — give life a shot,” she said.

   She told the graduates to “find your passion, your place to contribute,
   your place to shine.”

   Devine also encouraged students to stay in touch with ASU and the
   Cronkite School by joining the alumni association, visiting campus and
   connecting with fellow Sun Devils if they move to a new city.

   Her decision to give back to ASU was influenced by a mentor she met
   when she moved to Los Angeles, who she credits with helping her develop
   as a young woman and professional at the time.

   “You don’t need to touch the masses, but please work to touch just one
   life, just one person,” she said.

   In total, 337 students received degrees, including ​​80 with a Bachelor
   of Arts in mass communication and media studies, 53 with a Bachelor of
   Arts in journalism and mass communication, 61 with a Bachelor of
   Science in digital audiences, 30 Bachelor of Arts in sports journalism
   and one with a Bachelor of Arts in digital media literacy.

   The Cronkite School also awarded 111 master’s degrees. That includes 58
   with a Master of Science in digital audience strategy, 16 with a Master
   of Mass Communication, 21 with a Master of Arts in sports journalism,
   15 with a Master of Arts in investigative journalism and one with a
   Master of Science in business journalism. One student received a PhD in
   Journalism and Mass Communication.

   Student speaker Raven Payne referred to her fellow classmates as
   resilient for having endured a global pandemic during their time at the
   Cronkite School, which forced them to adjust the way they learned,
   worked on projects and reported their stories.

   Payne implored her classmates to follow their own paths, create their
   opportunities and not to settle.

   “Times are changing, and if they don’t change fast enough, we will
   change them ourselves,” she said. “We have the pen, paper and will to
   be the authors of our own stories.”
