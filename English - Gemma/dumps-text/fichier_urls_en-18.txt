   DPIC Releases Major New Report on Race and the U.S. Death Penalty

   The Death Penalty Information Center has released a major new report on
   race and the U.S. death penalty, providing an in-depth look at the
   historical role race has played in the death penalty and detailing the
   pervasive impact racial discrimination continues to have throughout
   every stage of a death penalty case today. Enduring Injustice: the
   Persistence of Racial Discrimination in the U.S. Death Penalty.
   released on September 15, 2020, also makes the case for why redressing
   discrimination in the American death penalty is essential if the United
   States is serious about creating a fair and just criminal legal system.

   In early news coverage of the report, the Associated Press wrote: “The
   report from the Death Penalty Information Center is a history lesson in
   how lynchings and executions have been used in America and how
   discrimination bleeds into the entire criminal justice system. It
   traces a line from lynchings of old — killings outside the law — where
   Black people were killed in an effort to assert social control during
   slavery and Jim Crow, and how that eventually translated into
   state-ordered executions.”

   “The death penalty is inextricably linked to our history of slavery, of
   lynching, and Jim Crow segregation, and we wanted to put what is
   happening today in its appropriate context,” DPIC Executive Director
   Robert Dunham told Associated Press. “[W]hat the data tells us and what
   history tells us is that they’re all part of the same phenomenon.”

   The Memphis Commercial Appeal noted that the report was released in an
   environment of social upheaval in which “[o]pponents of the death
   penalty are finding their arguments about the history of
   state-sanctioned executions fit into a wider discourse about racial
   injustice amid nationwide protests against police brutality and
   racism.”

   Ngozi Ndulue, DPIC’s Senior Director of Research and Special Projects
   and the author of the report, agreed. “We have seen more explicit
   reference to the continued racial discrimination in the death penalty
   in the last few months,” she told the Commercial Appeal. “This is a
   moment that advocates are really looking for concrete changes and what
   we’re trying to do with this report — the bulk of it was written before
   the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd — ties really
   into the moment of reckoning of racial justice the country is having
   right now.”

   The report documents the historic role the U.S. death penalty has
   played as an instrument of social control, tracing its use during
   slavery as a tool for controlling Black populations and curbing
   rebellions through the post-Civil War era in which lynchings and other
   extrajudicial violence rose in prominence and public officials promised
   legal executions as a means to discourage “vigilante justice.” As
   lynchings decreased in the early 20th century, the report says,
   executions began to take their place in some of the same circumstances
   that earlier would have ended in lynchings.

   The report cites Virginia as an illustration of the racist deployment
   of capital punishment. “Before the Civil War, Virginia explicitly
   provided different penalties for white people and its enslaved
   population,” the report says. “By 1848, white people could be sentenced
   to death only for first-degree murder while enslaved Black people could
   be executed for a number of non-homicide offenses.” By the 20^th
   century, the racial categorization of crimes was gone from the law
   books but was retained in practice. From 1900 through 1969, the report
   shows, 258 African Americans were executed, as compared to 46 whites.
   Forty-eight Black men were executed for rape, 20 for attempted rape,
   and 5 for armed robbery. No white person was executed for any crime
   that did not result in death. The same pattern prevailed across the
   South, with hundreds of African-American men condemned and executed for
   the alleged rape or attempted rape of white women or girls. No white
   man was ever executed for raping a Black woman or girl.

   The report also explains that racial bias persists today, as evidenced
   by cases with white victims being more likely to be investigated and
   capitally charged; systemic exclusion of jurors of color from service
   in death-penalty trials; and disproportionate imposition of death
   sentences against defendants of color. “The death penalty has been used
   to enforce racial hierarchies throughout United States history,
   beginning with the colonial period and continuing to this day,” Ndulue
   said.

   Among the evidence of continuing discrimination in the use of the death
   penalty, the report references:
     * A 2015 meta-analysis of 30 studies showing that the killers of
       white people were more likely than the killers of Black people to
       face a capital prosecution.
     * A study in North Carolina showing that qualified Black jurors were
       struck from juries at more than twice the rate of qualified white
       jurors. As of 2010, 20 percent of those on the state’s death row
       were sentenced to death by all-white juries.
     * Data showing that since executions resumed in 1977, 295
       African-American defendants have been executed for interracial
       murders of white victims, while only 21 white defendants have been
       executed for interracial murders of African Americans.
     * A 2014 mock jury study of more than 500 Californians that found
       white jurors were more likely to sentence poor Latinx defendants to
       death than poor white defendants.
     * Data showing that exonerations of African Americans for murder
       convictions are 22 percent more likely to be linked to police
       misconduct.

   “Racial disparities are present at every stage of a capital case and
   get magnified as a case moves through the legal process,” Dunham said.
   “If you don’t understand the history, … you won’t understand why. With
   the continuing police and white vigilante killings of Black citizens,
   it is even more important now to focus attention on the outsized role
   the death penalty plays as an agent and validator of racial
   discrimination. What is broken or intentionally discriminatory in the
   criminal legal system is visibly worse in death-penalty cases. Exposing
   how the system discriminates in capital cases can shine an important
   light on law enforcement and judicial practices in vital need of
   abolition, restructuring, or reform.”

   The death penalty’s “discriminatory presence as the apex punishment in
   the American legal system legitimizes all other harsh and
   discriminatory punishments,” Ndulue said. “That is why the death
   penalty must be part of any discussion of police reform, prosecutorial
   accountability, reversing mass incarceration, and the criminal legal
   system as a whole.”
