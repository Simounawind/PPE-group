West Texas Parents Suing Schools Over Racism, Demand Action Over Antisemitism

School leaders have said they don’t tolerate racism or bullying. But parents
say inaction by officials tells a different story

   LUBBOCK — Parents, full of anger and disbelief, have confronted school
   leaders in the Lubbock area over a series of racist and antisemitic
   incidents in several schools.

   In total, four separate incidents have come to light in recent weeks.

   Two episodes — both involving Black students targeted in constant
   bullying by their peers and inaction by school officials, parents say —
   have led to separate federal civil rights lawsuits.

   At the heart of the two lawsuits is the pain parents say their children
   have endured as a result of months of constant and violent bullying —
   including an Instagram account that posted photos of Black students
   from a Lubbock middle school with racist captions, and racial
   discrimination by school officials against students at the high school
   in Slaton, about 17 miles south of Lubbock.

   A third South Plains school district — Roosevelt ISD — had a parent
   file a federal complaint against them for racial discrimination by
   school officials. There, a mother took her daughter out of school after
   she claims school officials targeted her child for undue disciplinary
   actions.

   Meanwhile, a threatening antisemitic petition was passed around by a
   student at another Lubbock middle school. Parents say they are
   disappointed the school hasn’t had a strong response.

   On their own, these might seem like isolated incidents of school-age
   angst. However, racially driven and antisemitic incidents are on the
   rise in Texas. And now four different school districts in the South
   Plains are facing tensions emblematic of the widespread problem.
   Instead of addressing it directly, parents say school officials try to
   sweep the issues under the rug.

   Lubbock-Cooper ISD — which includes Laura Bush Middle School, where the
   Instagram account was based — declined to comment on the federal
   lawsuit.

   “Racism has no place at any school within Lubbock-Cooper ISD,” the
   district added in a statement. “It is not a reflection of our beliefs
   as a school and it completely contradicts the virtues we wish to
   instill in our students.”

   were allegedly bullied over months, including with an Instagram account
   that posted photos of them with racist captions. (Mark Rogers/The Texas
   Tribune)

   Lubbock parents are grappling with sending their children to schools
   where they may not feel safe because of their skin color or religion,
   particularly with officials at the helm who parents no longer trust.

   “They know that there’s a problem but they don’t want to do anything
   about it,” said Tracy Kemp, a mother of three kids in the
   Lubbock-Cooper district and a participant in the federal complaint.
   “They would rather us leave than to change.”

   Black students make up 3% of Lubbock-Cooper’s student body. The
   complaint, which was a joint filing with the families, Intercultural
   Development Research Association and the Lubbock NAACP, alleges the
   school is known for its frequent, consistent and extreme discriminatory
   practices against its Black students.

   The Lubbock-Cooper school district covers Southwest Lubbock, serving
   families on the farthest edges of Lubbock’s newest developed area and
   families from nearby communities.

   The complaint details the near-daily harassment and bullying several
   Black students had to endure since last spring, which included being
   called racial slurs and hearing the sounds of cracking whips as they
   walked through the halls.

   The complaint also alleges that the incidents — which lasted for months
   — would often lead to physical threats and acts of violence against
   Black students by their white peers. Kemp’s son was one of the students
   targeted in these assaults. Kemp thinks the attacks escalated because
   she was bringing attention to the matter. The school, she said, still
   hasn’t had a meaningful response in more than eight months.

   “They have nothing to show for it because they’ve done nothing about
   it,” Kemp said. “They’ve put out damage control statements because
   we’ve gone to the press, but they’ve never come to us.”

   Parents reported the hostile acts to school administration, but they
   say officials didn’t take action to end the harassment and would often
   punish the victims. Lubbock-Cooper ISD said it has responded to
   complaints by instituting more diversity training among teachers,
   administrators and students.

   officials against students at the high school in Slaton, about 17 miles
   south of Lubbock. (Mark Rogers/The Texas Tribune)

   Similar incidents were reported in the complaint against Slaton High
   School, where there are about 20 Black students. In one instance, the
   lawsuit claims, a Black student faced unfair punishment for retaliating
   against a white student for repeatedly calling her racist slurs. In a
   statement to NBC News, Slaton Superintendent Jim Andrus said the
   district trains staff regularly on how to address bullying allegations.

   At Hutchinson Middle School in Lubbock, a parent alleged a student
   asked peers to sign a sheet of paper after calling for violence against
   Jewish people, according to emails obtained by The Texas Tribune. The
   parent suggested not all students who signed understood what it was for
   and some students signed, with real and fake names.

   Administrators determined there was not an imminent threat to students
   and did not send out an email informing the public, despite being asked
   to do so by a Jewish parent. The school district claimed sending an
   email out would be a violation of the Family Educational Rights and
   Privacy Act because it could reveal the student’s identity.

   Lubbock Rabbi Deborah Goldmann emailed the principal and superintendent
   about the incident. In emails obtained by the Tribune, Goldmann said
   the community learns the behavior is acceptable because there was no
   response.

   Jewish people, according to emails obtained by The Texas Tribune. (Mark
   Rogers/The Texas Tribune)

   Michael Stewart, the principal of Hutchinson Middle School, responded
   to her saying the school has addressed the behavior with the individual
   involved and students who signed and that they are developing lessons
   to address the cultural and religious backgrounds of students.

   “It does seem that you are beating around the bush and uncomfortable
   addressing antisemitism,” Goldmann wrote back. “If they felt
   comfortable going around asking people to sign that paper, they are in
   an environment where other students feel the same level of comfort.”

   Roosevelt ISD, 10 miles east of Lubbock, is also facing an official
   complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil
   Rights. Kristen Arnold alleges that her daughter was being racially
   discriminated against by school officials and was falling behind in
   classes because of unjust punishments. In an effort to protect her
   daughter’s mental health, Arnold pulled her from Roosevelt High School
   just before her senior year. She is now doing a homeschool program to
   be able to graduate.

   “They literally harassed her right out of high school,” Arnold told the
   Tribune. “She’s been struggling with depression and anxiety.”

   According to emails obtained by the Tribune, Arnold shared her concerns
   and attempted to meet with Roosevelt Superintendent Dallas Grimes about
   the problem in May. In response, Grimes said they have heard her
   grievances and were aware of the report she was filing.

   “Unless there is new information to educate me on, I’m not sure what
   the purpose of the meeting would be,” the email reads.

   Arnold was intimidated by the response and withdrew her complaints, but
   refiled in June. The case is now pending at the federal department of
   education. In an email to the Tribune, Grimes said the district knew
   she withdrew her complaints but was unaware of the new filing.
