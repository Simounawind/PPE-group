State Farm accused of covert racial discrimination in claims processing

   A Black Illinois homeowner claims State Farm practices covert racial
   discrimination in how it processes claims.

   “State Farm does not treat its Black and white homeowners insurance
   policyholders equally,” states a federal lawsuit filed by Jacqueline
   Huskey of Matteson in south suburban Chicago.

   The filing claims the Bloomington-based company uses computer
   algorithms that have the effect of disproportionately delaying claims
   of African American homeowners. White homeowners were almost a third
   more likely than Black homeowners to have their claim processed
   expeditiously — in less than a month. It alleges the company is 39%
   more likely to ask for additional information from Black homeowners.

   “We take this filing seriously. This suit does not reflect the values
   we hold at State Farm,” said a State Farm statement.

   Huskey said State Farm repeatedly delayed assessing hail damage to her
   house, forced her to provide additional information, and declined to
   pay part of the claim for external damage to the home. The lawsuit
   alleges Huskey is far from alone.

   Huskey's lawyers said they based their case for systemic racial
   discrimination on a study of more than 800 State Farm policyholders in
   the Midwestern states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio,
   and Wisconsin. The Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law at New York
   University School of Law did the survey and analysis.

   “Claims made by Black homeowners are disproportionately subjected to
   greater suspicion than claims made by their white counterparts: State
   Farm is more likely to request additional claims documentation from
   Black claimants and Black claimants must have more interactions with
   State Farm employees to resolve their claims,” according to the
   lawsuit.

   The center declined a WGLT request for an interview, citing the
   litigation. The filing in the northern district of Illinois asks for
   class action status.

   “Inequitable practices such as these make it more difficult for Black
   homeowners to build wealth through home ownership at the same rate as
   white homeowners,” alleges the suit.

   Attorneys claimed the study shows the difference in the rates the
   company asks Black and white homeowners to provide extra information
   about is less than 1% likely to be random chance. Longer claims
   processing time for Black customers is less than 5% likely to be by
   chance, according to the study. The lawsuit alleges State Farm's data
   mining of information such as physical appearance, genetics,
   geo-location, social media presence, and browser search history,
   functions as a proxy for race. The case also claims historical housing
   and claims data used by State Farm are "infected with racial bias."

   “State Farm’s claims processing methods have a demonstrable and
   widespread discriminatory impact on Black homeowners making insurance
   claims, in violation of the FHA,” asserts the lawsuit.

   The practices, the suit contends, contribute to societal difficulties
   Black people have in creating intergenerational wealth, financial
   security, and preservation of home values. The case suggested State
   Farm is far from alone in use of computer machine learning programs
   that fail to be even-handed.

   “In recent years, algorithmic decision-making has produced biased,
   discriminatory, and otherwise problematic outcomes in some of the most
   important areas of the American economy. ... These harms are often felt
   most acutely by historically disadvantaged populations, especially
   Black Americans and other communities of color,” according to a comment
   by Federal Trade Commissioner Kelly Slaughter that is referenced in the
   court filing.

   Other figures cited in the lawsuit laid out a landscape tilted against
   Black families.

   “In 2020, 73.7% of white families owned homes, compared to only 44% of
   Black families,” found economists at Freddie Mac in 2020, that
   continued, "12.5% of homes in majority Black areas are appraised below
   the price agreed upon by the buyer and seller, compared to just 7.4% of
   homes in majority-white areas.” f.

   Researchers also have determined that relative to their home value,
   Black homeowners pay higher mortgage rates, spend more on mortgage
   insurance, face a higher share of maintenance costs, and pay more in
   property taxes than white homeowners, resulting in a higher home
   ownership cost burden.

   “State Farm is committed to a diverse and inclusive environment, where
   all customers and associates are treated with fairness, respect, and
   dignity. We are dedicated to paying what we owe, promptly and
   courteously,” said the company.
