Airbnb finds people have more trouble booking stays if hosts think they are
Black

   New York CNN  —

   Airbnb on Tuesday said it has found a “meaningful difference” in the
   booking success rate for users who are perceived to be White compared
   to those who are perceived to be Black. The findings come after the
   company launched an initiative to uncover and remedy race-based
   discrimination on its platform.

   While all users successfully had their reservations confirmed by hosts
   more than 90% of the time in 2021, Airbnb said it found a notable gap
   in user experiences during that time depending on their apparent racial
   identity. Users who were perceived to be White had a booking success
   rate of 94.1% while users who were thought to be Black had a success
   rate of 91.4%, according to the company. (Those perceived as Asian and
   Latino/Hispanic had booking success rates sitting in between.)

   “It is a meaningful difference, and it’s unacceptable,”Janaye Ingram,
   Airbnb’s director of community partner programs and engagement, told
   CNN. “It is something that we obviously are not okay with and we are
   doing a lot to address.”

   The findings are part of Project Lighthouse, an effort launched by
   Airbnb in 2020 to collect data on racial discrepancies on its service.
   The project was developed in partnership with Color of Change, the
   nation’s largest online racial justice organization, and with the
   support of other national privacy and civil rights organizations like
   the NAACP and Asian Americans Advancing Justice.

   Airbnb’s efforts to address racial disparity on its platform come after
   the company repeatedly faced scrutiny on the issue. A 2015 study from
   Harvard found that Airbnb hosts were less likely to rent to guests with
   names that sounded African American. The next year, Airbnb was hit with
   a lawsuit accusing it of discriminatory housing practices. (A federal
   judge later blocked the suit.) And in 2019, the company settled a
   lawsuit from several Black women in Oregon alleging customers were
   discriminated against based on their race.

   The company said Tuesday that information collected through the Project
   Lighthouse initiative is being used to inform the company’s approach to
   bookings and reviews in an effort to minimize racial discrimination for
   prospective guests.

   “You can’t fix what you don’t measure,” Ingram said.

   Airbnb has taken a number of steps in recent years to address concerns
   about racial disparities on its platform, including getting rid of
   guests’ profile pictures prior to booking, making more people eligible
   for the “Instant Book” feature that bypasses host approval, auditing
   booking rejections and making it easier for all guests to receive
   reviews, according to the company.

   On Tuesday, Airbnb said Project Lighthouse revealed another potential
   issue in need of tweaking: guests with more reviews have higher booking
   success rates than those without, and guests perceived to be White or
   Asian have more reviews than others. In response, Airbnb plans to make
   it easier for all guests to receive a review when they travel, an
   effort that it hopes will have a large impact on the Black and Latino
   or Hispanic communities.

   The findings released on Tuesday come after Airbnb conducted two racial
   audits in 2016 and 2019.

   “Racial audits work, as long as corporations make the changes necessary
   to address what they expose,” said Rashad Robinson, president of Color
   Of Change. “Six years after Airbnb’s first racial audit, and two years
   after Color Of Change negotiated Project Lighthouse, Airbnb is now a
   leading example of what it looks like to back up the rhetoric of racial
   justice with the policy, practice and personnel that can prevent
   rampant racial discrimination.”
