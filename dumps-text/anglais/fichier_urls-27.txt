The Latest Threat to the Voting Rights Act: Merrill v. Milligan

   Blog / Last Updated: December 8, 2022

   Share this:

   This blog was written by legal intern Gabby Means.

   In the last decade, the US Supreme Court has severely weakened the
   Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), which was widely agreed to be the most
   effective civil rights law in our history.

   Beginning with its 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which
   gutted the VRA by rendering Section 5 ineffective, the Court has
   chipped away at the power of the VRA. Most recently, the Court weakened
   Section 2 of the VRA, one of the last protections against racially
   discriminatory voting laws. It did so in the 2021 decision in Brnovich
   v. Democratic National Committee, where the Court made it more
   difficult for voting rights plaintiffs to challenge racially
   discriminatory voting laws in court.

   This term, the Court considers Section 2 again in Merrill v. Milligan.
   This time, the Court threatens to weaken well-established precedent
   lower courts have used for decades to evaluate redistricting plans
   alleged to be racially discriminatory. In this blog, we will explore
   the history of Section 2 and its impact on discriminatory redistricting
   plans, explain the dispute at issue in Milligan, and preview potential
   next steps to protect voting rights.

Background on the Voting Rights Act

   The VRA was passed in response to deliberate efforts to prevent Black
   Americans from voting, including violence and terror. States —
   particularly in the South — were thwarting their pro-equality,
   anti-discrimination obligations under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
   Amendments, and Congress determined further protections were
   required.

   The VRA created remarkable remedies and protections to ensure that no
   one is prevented from participating in the political process because of
   their race. Its core protections are in Section 5 and Section 2 of the
   Act. Section 5 established a system of “federal preclearance,” which
   required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in
   voting to seek preapproval before making any changes to their voting
   practices. For voters harmed by jurisdictions with racially
   discriminatory voting policies and practices, Section 2 provided them
   with legal recourse.

   The Voting Rights Act was reauthorized — with strong bipartisan support
   — multiple times, most recently in 2006. But in 2013, the US Supreme
   Court held that the Section 5 coverage formula for determining which
   jurisdictions must submit to federal preclearance was not justified by
   current conditions. The decision essentially nullified Section 5 until
   a new coverage formula is passed in Congress (which has yet to occur).
   As the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in her dissent, “throwing
   out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop
   discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a
   rainstorm because you are not getting wet.” Unsurprisingly, since this
   decision, several restrictive state voting rights laws have been
   enacted.

   Section 2 of the VRA has always been critical to protect voters, but
   without a functioning Section 5, Section 2 is even more necessary to
   challenge policies and practices that intend to or effect of harming
   voters of color. As explored below, Merrill v. Milligan threatens
   Section 2 and voters’ ability to use it to challenge racial
   discrimination in voting.

Claims Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act: Vote Denial & Vote Dilution

   Under Section 2(a) of the VRA, states may not pass any law that
   “results in a denial or abridgment” of the right to vote “on account of
   race or color.” Put simply, Section 2 prohibits any standard, practice,
   or procedure imposed or applied to deny or limit the right to vote
   based on race or color.

   Cases brought under Section 2 have historically involved two types of
   violations:

   1) Vote dilution; and

   2) Vote denial.

Vote Denial

   Vote denial claims typically challenge practices that render voting
   “not equally open to participation” for voters protected by Section 2 —
   racial and language minority groups. They became more common as states
   rushed to pass restrictive voting laws after the Shelby County
   decision. A common vote denial claim post-Shelby County are challenges
   to restrictive photo ID laws that disproportionately prevent voters of
   color from voting.

   Until the ruling in Brnovich, the Supreme Court had not squarely
   addressed Section 2 vote denial claims. As noted in our previous blog,
   the Court in Brnovich dealt a blow to voters’ ability to challenge
   racial discrimination in voting under Section 2.

Vote Dilution

   The most common and well-established use of Section 2 — and the claim
   raised in Milligan v. Merrill — is a vote dilution claim, raised in the
   context of redistricting and changes to jurisdiction boundaries. A
   violation of Section 2 occurs when states draw districts in a way that
   gives voters of color less power “to elect representatives of their
   choice.”

   The earliest vote dilution cases concerned at-large voting; an election
   scheme used to drown out the power of voters of color. More recently,
   vote dilution claims have been brought to challenge redistricting plans
   that dilute the political power of Black residents and other
   communities of color on the local, state, and federal levels.

   The Supreme Court has decided several vote dilution cases since the VRA
   was passed in 1965, including Thornburg v. Gingles in 1986, which
   established the test to evaluate claims of racial vote dilution in
   district boundaries. To establish a Section 2 violation under Gingles,
   plaintiffs must show that instead of the challenged map or boundaries
   which dilute the power of voters of color, an acceptable district could
   be drawn that would allow voters of color to elect a candidate of
   choice.

Merrill v. Milligan

   On October 4, 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Merrill
   v. Milligan. Plaintiffs — Alabama voters and voting rights
   organizations — challenged the congressional map passed by the Alabama
   legislature after the 2020 census. The new map maintained only one
   majority-Black congressional district out of seven total districts,
   despite the fact that 27% of the Alabama population is Black. This
   percentage suggests that there could — and, according to the Milligan
   plaintiffs, should — be two districts where Black voters can elect a
   candidate of choice. After the presentation of evidence, a three-judge
   panel at the district court found a likely Section 2 violation and
   irreparable harm to Black voters. The court ordered lawmakers to draw a
   new map that satisfies the requirements of Section 2.

   Instead of accepting the ruling and working to address the violation on
   behalf of the state’s Black voters, the state filed an emergency appeal
   to the Supreme Court to halt the lower court order suspending Alabama’s
   map. The Supreme Court agreed, which meant that the Alabama
   congressional map, which a three-judge panel had struck down at the
   federal district court, would be in place for the upcoming 2022
   election season. On October 4, 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral
   arguments.

   demanding fair maps

   Merrill v. Milligan is a straightforward vote dilution case, with an
   outcome dictated by Supreme Court precedent. As Justice Kagan noted
   during oral arguments, “this case should be a slam dunk.” Even Chief
   Justice Roberts agreed in his dissent to the emergency stay order,
   stating, “the District Court properly applied existing law in an
   extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction.” So why
   is the Supreme Court hearing this case?

   The state argues that its “race-neutral” map — which only creates one
   majority-Black congressional district — should not be disqualified just
   because it is possible to draw two majority-Black districts in Alabama.
   They suggest that the VRA prohibits denying votes on account of race
   but does not affirmatively obligate states to redistrict on account of
   race. The state urges that the first prong of the Gingles test, that
   the community of color must be “sufficiently large and geographically
   compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district,” should
   be a race-blind test. Alabama’s argument does not square with the
   purpose and history of the VRA, which is specifically focused on
   rooting out racial discrimination in voting pursuant to Congress's
   power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.

   Alabama voters in the Milligan case argue that Alabama violated Section
   2 by “packing” and “cracking” Black residents to limit their political
   power. Importantly, they also argue that requiring the first prong of
   Gingles to be race-blind would defeat the purpose of Section 2, which
   is to protect voters of color from having their political power
   diminished. During oral argument, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown
   Jackson acknowledged the historical importance of race in VRA case law,
   noting that “it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted
   the equal protection clause, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth
   Amendment, in a race-conscious way. That they were, in fact, trying to
   ensure that people who had been discriminated against . . . were
   brought equal to everyone else in the society.”

   The League of Women Voters of Alabama and the League of Women Voters of
   the United States filed an amicus brief supporting Alabama voters in
   the case, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center and Stand-Up
   Mobile. The League’s brief urges the Supreme Court to uphold the
   district court ruling, which found a violation of Section 2. The brief
   explains how a second majority-Black district can be drawn to satisfy
   Section 2 by combining two communities in Alabama with deep ties to
   each other: the city of Mobile and Alabama’s Black Belt. The brief can
   be found here.

What's Next?

   It's essential that the Supreme Court uphold the Alabama district court
   ruling and protect the longstanding protections Section 2 provides for
   voters. Should the Court rule in Alabama’s favor, future rulings
   striking down racially discriminatory redistricting plans could be put
   at risk. This is already occurring: in June 2022, a district court in
   Louisiana found a Section 2 violation for that state’s congressional
   map, but the decision has stayed pending the outcoming in Milligan. The
   racially discriminatory Louisiana congressional map has thus been
   allowed to go into effect for the 2022 election season. If the Supreme
   Court rules in favor of Alabama, the Louisiana case could suffer the
   same fate.

   This case emphasizes the importance of restoring the Voting Rights Act
   to its full strength and passing federal voting rights protections.
   Encourage your representatives to do so: let Congress know they must
   pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to
   Vote Act to protect voters from discriminatory and suppressive voting
   practices.

   A decision in Merrill v. Milligan is expected in the spring or summer
   of 2023.

   Brnovich: A Significant Blow to Our Freedom to Vote

   On July 1, in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, the Supreme
   Court dealt a significant blow to the freedom to vote. The decision
   held that Arizona laws discounting ballots cast out of precinct and
   banning nonrelative neighbors or friends to deliver mail-in ballots did
   not violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965, despite these laws’ negative
   effects on Black and brown voters. It is a major loss for voting rights
   at a time when this sacred freedom is under attack across the nation.
