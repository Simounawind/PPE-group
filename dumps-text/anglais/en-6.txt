U.S. Delegation to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination

   Media Note

   [154]Office of the Spokesperson

   August 9, 2022

   The Biden-Harris administration is deeply committed to addressing the
   challenges of systemic racism both at home and abroad, including the
   structures, policies, laws, and practices that sustain racial
   injustices.  The administration further believes that any pledge to
   advance human rights around the world must begin with a pledge to
   advance human rights at home.

   In that context, the United States has assembled a diverse interagency
   delegation to the upcoming meeting of the Committee on the Elimination
   of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in Geneva, Switzerland (August 11-12).

   The delegation will be led by Ambassador Michèle Taylor, U.S. Permanent
   Representative to the UN Human Rights Council, and Desirée Cormier
   Smith, the State Department's Special Representative for Racial Equity
   and Justice.  It will also feature representatives from nearly a dozen
   executive branch agencies including the Departments of Justice, Labor,
   and Education, as well as Mayor of Atlanta Andre Dickens and
   representatives from the office of California's Attorney General.

   While in Geneva, the delegation will present the 2021 report on the
   implementation of U.S. obligations under the International Convention
   on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  The report
   outlines actions taken by the U.S. Government to promote racial equity
   and address systemic racism and discrimination.

   In preparation for the presentation, the United States hosted a series
   of consultations with American civil society on a wide range of issues
   of concern to marginalized racial and ethnic communities.  U.S.
   participation in this process reflects the administration's abiding
   commitment to human rights treaty obligations, and its firm belief that
   the United States must lead by example.

   A [155]fact sheet on the Periodic Report of the United States of
   America to The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial
   Discrimination is available online.

   If you have any questions about the U.S. CERD presentation or need more
   information, please contact USCERD2022@state.gov.
