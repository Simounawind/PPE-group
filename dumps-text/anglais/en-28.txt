   CNN -- The US Justice Department on Wednesday filed what it is
   describing as a first-of-its-kind settlement in a racial discrimination
   case challenging a so-called "crime-free housing ordinance."

   The proposed consent decree was filed Wednesday in a lawsuit the
   Justice Department brought in 2019 against the central California city
   of Hesperia, alleging that the city's ordinance violated the Fair
   Housing Act's prohibitions on racial discrimination in housing access.

   Hesperia continues to deny the allegations.

   According to DOJ's court filings, the 2015 ordinance instructed
   landlords to evict tenants accused of criminal conduct, even if those
   allegations have not resulted in an arrest or a conviction.

   "As our complaint makes clear, Hesperia's ordinance was a blatantly
   racially discriminatory solution to a problem that didn't exist,"
   Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clark, who leads the DOJ Civil
   Rights division, said on a press call Wednesday.

   She noted under the program, Black renters were almost four times more
   likely to be evicted than White renters and Latino renters were 29%
   more likely to be evicted.

   She said that some 2,000 jurisdictions across 48 states have enacted
   similar policies and that the new settlement sent a signal to other
   communities that they'd be held accountable if their housing policies
   violated anti-discrimination law.

   "This landmark agreement is historic," Clark said. "It marks the
   Justice Department's first settlement in a case challenge a crime-free
   ordinance and results in the full repeal of the program and nearly $1
   million in monetary commitment."

   Last month, the city repealed the ordinance, which was previously
   amended in 2017 to make the program voluntary. According to the Justice
   Department, Hesperia and its co-defendants -- the county of San
   Bernardino and the San Bernardino Sheriffs Department -- have agreed to
   pay a $950,000 settlement.

   It will compensate people who were harmed under the policy and will
   cover anti-discrimination training and other initiatives.

   A lawyer for Hesperia said that the city's move to resolve the case
   "was based solely on a sound financial decision on behalf of the
   citizens of the City."

   "At no time has the City admitted liability in this matter, and the
   City continues to vehemently deny all allegations contained within the
   complaint filed by the Department of Justice," the lawyer, J. Pat
   Ferraris told CNN in an email.
