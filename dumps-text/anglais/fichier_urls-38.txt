DPIC Releases Report Placing Death Penalty in Historical Context as a
“Descendant of Slavery, Lynching, and Segregation”

Death Penalty Must Be Part of Current Debate About Criminal Legal System
Reforms

   (Washington, D.C.) As social movements pressure policymakers to redress
   injustices in the criminal legal system and to institute reforms to
   make the process more fair and equitable, the Death Penalty Information
   Center (DPIC) today released, “Enduring Injustice: the Persistence of
   Racial Discrimination in the U.S. Death Penalty.” This report provides
   an in-depth look at the historical role that race has played in the
   death penalty and details the pervasive role racial discrimination
   continues to play in the administration of capital punishment today.

   “The death penalty has been used to enforce racial hierarchies
   throughout United States history, beginning with the colonial period
   and continuing to this day,” said Ngozi Ndulue, DPIC’s Senior Director
   of Research and Special Projects and the report’s lead author. “Its
   discriminatory presence as the apex punishment in the American legal
   system legitimizes all other harsh and discriminatory punishments. That
   is why the death penalty must be part of any discussion of police
   reform, prosecutorial accountability, reversing mass incarceration, and
   the criminal legal system as a whole.” Ms. Ndulue previously served as
   the NAACP’s Senior Director of Criminal Justice Programs and as a
   capital appeals lawyer.

   “Racial disparities are present at every stage of a capital case and
   get magnified as a case moves through the legal process,” said Robert
   Dunham, DPIC’s Executive Director and the report’s editor. “If you
   don’t understand the history — that the modern death penalty is the
   direct descendant of slavery, lynching, and Jim Crow-segregation — you
   won’t understand why. With the continuing police and white vigilante
   killings of Black citizens, it is even more important now to focus
   attention on the outsized role the death penalty plays as an agent and
   validator of racial discrimination. What is broken or intentionally
   discriminatory in the criminal legal system is visibly worse in
   death-penalty cases. Exposing how the system discriminates in capital
   cases can shine an important light on law enforcement and judicial
   practices in vital need of abolition, restructuring, or reform.”

   The report documents the historic role of the U.S. death penalty as an
   instrument of social control. During slavery, capital punishment was a
   tool for controlling Black populations and curbing rebellions. After
   the Civil War, public officials promised legal executions as a means to
   discourage lynchings. As lynchings decreased in the early 20^th
   century, executions began to take their place in circumstances that
   earlier would have drawn a lynch mob. Across the South,
   African-American men were condemned and executed for the alleged rape
   or attempted rape of white women or girls. No white man was ever
   executed for raping a Black woman or girl.

   Racial bias persists today, as evidenced by cases with white victims
   being more likely to be investigated and capitally charged; systemic
   exclusion of jurors of color from service in death-penalty trials; and
   disproportionate imposition of death sentences against defendants of
   color. The report provides compelling evidence of racial bias in the
   modern death penalty, including:
     * A 2015 meta-analysis of 30 studies showed that the killers of white
       people were more likely than the killers of Black people to face a
       capital prosecution.
     * A study in North Carolina showed that qualified Black jurors were
       struck from juries at more than twice the rate of qualified white
       jurors. As of 2010, 20 percent of those on the state’s death row
       were sentenced to death by all-white juries.
     * Since executions resumed in 1977, 295 African-Americans defendants
       have been executed for the murder of a white victim, while only 21
       white defendants have been executed for the murder of an
       African-American victim.
     * A 2014 mock jury study of more than 500 Californians found that
       white jurors were more likely to sentence poor Latinx defendants to
       death than poor white defendants.
     * Exonerations of African Americans for murder convictions are 22
       percent more likely to be linked to police misconduct.

   The report highlights several pending death penalty cases where racial
   discrimination played a role in driving death sentences for Black
   defendants. For example:
     * Abu-Ali Abdur’Rahman, Tennessee. In 2019, Davidson County District
       Attorney General Glenn Funk conceded that Abu-Ali Abdur’Rahman’s
       trial had been infected by overt racial bias. Abdur’Rahman had long
       argued that the prosecutor struck two Black potential jurors based
       on racial stereotypes. The trial court agreed to a reduced
       sentence, but the Tennessee Attorney General’s Office is currently
       appealing.
     * Julius Jones, Oklahoma. Julius Jones, who has a strong innocence
       claim, was convicted and sentenced to death by a nearly all-white
       jury for killing a white businessman. His case was riddled with
       racial discrimination, including an officer using a racial slur
       during his arrest, prosecutors striking every Black potential juror
       but one, and a juror who used the n-word to describe Jones. His
       petition for clemency is currently pending.
     * Federal Death Penalty. Although the first set of executions
       scheduled by the federal government in 2020 have been strategically
       directed at white people, the federal death penalty has long been
       plagued by the same racial bias present in state death penalty
       systems. Thirty-four of the 57 people currently on federal death
       row are people of color, including 26 Black men. Some were
       convicted and condemned by all-white juries. In an action widely
       regarded as an assault on Native sovereignty, the sole Native
       American on federal death row was executed for an offense on tribal
       lands over the repeated objection of his tribe and Native American
       leaders across the country.
