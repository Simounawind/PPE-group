Daylight Saving Time sheds light on lack of sleep’s disproportionate impact
in communities of color

   Explain it to me: Daylight Saving Time
   02:01 - Source: CNN
   CNN  —

   As the United States rolled back the clocks one hour this month to
   observe the end of Daylight Saving Time, many people got a bit more
   sleep than usual – but some not as much as others.

   Growing evidence shows that lack of sleep and sleep disorders, such as
   obstructive sleep apnea, remain more prevalent in Black, Asian, and
   Hispanic or Latino communities, and these inequities can have long-term
   detrimental implications for physical health, even raising the risk of
   certain chronic diseases.

   Meanwhile, Daylight Saving Time itself – enacted in the US to reduce
   electricity usage by extending daylight hours – has long been
   controversial in the United States.
   A growing number of sleep experts say the act of moving our clocks
   forward for Daylight Savings Time in the spring is ruining our health.

   Permanent Daylight Saving Time will hurt our health, experts say

   The American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the Sleep Research Society and
   other medical groups have advocated for ending the practice, calling
   for the adoption of a permanent standard time that would not involve
   shifting forward each spring and falling back each autumn.

   “Daylight saving time is associated with increased risks of sleep loss,
   circadian misalignment, and adverse health consequences,” Dr. Beth
   Malow, professor of neurology and pediatrics and director of the
   Vanderbilt University Medical Center Sleep Division in Nashville, said
   in a news release this month. She authored a paper, published in
   September in the journal Sleep, detailing the potential health benefits
   of adopting a permanent standard time.

   In March, the US Senate unanimously passed the Sunshine Protection Act,
   which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent across the country –
   meaning there would be no reverting to “standard time” from early
   November through mid-March – but the legislation would have to pass the
   House and earn President Joe Biden’s signature before becoming
   effective in November 2023.

   Now, some sleep researchers worry about the potential effects that
   continuing to change standard time twice each year may have on sleep
   health inequities.

   Why and when the US started changing the clock

   “Poor sleep is associated with a host of poor health outcomes,
   including obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
   disease and certain cancers, including of the breast and colon. Many of
   these health outcomes are more prevalent in the Black population,” said
   Chandra Jackson, a researcher and epidemiologist with the National
   Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, who has been studying
   racial and ethnic disparities in sleep.

   “Experimental as well as observational studies have linked sleep to
   these health outcomes. Therefore, sleep could be an important
   contributor,” she said. “Fortunately, sleep health is largely
   modifiable.”

   As for the inequities seen in sleep health, it’s not that White adults
   don’t also experience a lack of sleep and its health consequences – but
   people of color appear to disproportionately experience them more, and
   that’s believed to be largely due to social systems in the United
   States.

What sleep does to the body

   Sleep allows the body to restore itself on a cellular level. During
   quality sleep, your heart rate, blood pressure and breathing can rise
   and fall, which may be important for cardiovascular health, and your
   body releases hormones that help repair cells and control its use of
   energy, according to the National Institutes of Health. These hormone
   changes also can influence your weight.

   A study published in October in the journal PLOS Medicine suggests that
   people 50 and older who sleep five hours or less at night have a higher
   risk of multiple chronic diseases as they age compared with peers who
   get a longer night’s rest.

   Separate research, also published in October in the journal of the
   American Heart Association, shows that cardiovascular health guidelines
   are more effective at predicting a person’s risk of heart disease if
   they include sleep – and not focus solely on diet and exercise.

   How to best prepare for time change

   Certain physiologic processes – such as immune function, cardiovascular
   health and memory formation – require certain amounts of sleep. So
   without enough sleep, the body and brain may not function optimally,
   said Dr. César Caraballo-Cordovez, a postdoctoral associate in the
   Yale-based Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation who has studied
   racial and ethnic disparities in sleep duration.

   “Short sleep duration has been associated with higher risk of adverse
   medical events and conditions, including diabetes, obesity,
   hypertension, heart disease, impaired cognitive functions, and death,”
   Caraballo-Cordovez wrote in an email, adding that the consensus is that
   most adults need at least seven hours of sleep per day.

   Yet the racial and ethnic disparities in sleep duration appear to be
   getting worse across the United States, according to recent research by
   Caraballo-Cordovez, Jackson and their colleagues. Their study,
   published in April in the medical journal JAMA Network Open, found that
   among more than 400,000 adults in the US, between 2004 and 2018, the
   prevalence of short and long sleep duration was persistently higher
   among those who were Black and Hispanic or Latino. Short sleep is less
   than seven hours in a day, and long sleep is more than nine hours.

   Although there was a significant increase in the prevalence of
   insufficient sleep across all groups during the study period, the
   prevalence of short sleep increased 6.39 and 6.61 percentage points
   among Black and Hispanic or Latino adults, respectively, compared with
   3.22 percentage points among White people.

   Several social and environmental factors that can interfere with sleep
   are more common among Black and Hispanic or Latino people in the US,
   Caraballo-Cordovez said.

   “Among those are housing conditions, noise pollution, light pollution,
   air pollution, stress from different sources – including perceived
   racial discrimination – and jobs or working conditions,” he said,
   adding that the convergence of all those factors may explain why
   getting the recommended amount of sleep “may be less common among Black
   adults than among White adults.”

   Caraballo-Cordovez and Jackson both emphasize that the causes behind
   the racial inequality of sleep warrant more research.

The ‘persistent barriers’ to quality sleep

   Many social and environmental determinants of health – including living
   conditions or work schedules that don’t support sleep – may emerge, at
   least in part, from historical and persistent forms of structural
   racism, which Jackson considers as the “totality of ways in which
   societies foster racial discrimination through mutually reinforcing
   systems of housing, education, employment, wages, benefits, credit,
   media, health care and criminal justice.”

   These variables affect whether you live, die or get help during the
   pandemic

   Jackson added that she often reflects on how the shooting death of
   Breonna Taylor in Louisville in March 2020 and the shooting of George
   Floyd’s 4-year-old grandniece in Houston on New Year’s Day both
   happened when they were asleep – and how systems of structural racism
   in the US can cultivate conditions that make such incidents more likely
   to happen in Black communities. “This would require research,” she
   said.

   Examples of structural racism and how they can have impacts on health
   include the history of discriminatory mortgage lending and appraisals
   in the US, which affect the conditions in which people of color may
   live; how predominantly white school districts tend to get more funding
   than districts serving people of color, influencing the quality of
   education some people of color may receive; and even how hair
   discrimination may contribute to some Black women using potentially
   harmful chemical hair products because policies might not allow
   specific hairstyles in school or the workplace.

   “These policies and practices can produce disparities due to the
   maldistribution of health-promoting or harming resources across racial
   groups and can, in turn, reinforce discriminatory beliefs,” Jackson
   said. “That is, it is believed that discriminatory policies and
   practices across sectors of society create the physical and social
   conditions that make it more difficult for Black families to get
   optimal sleep and grow up healthy. Fortunately, these policies and
   practices are also modifiable.”

   Although more research on the causes of disparities in sleep is needed,
   she said, essentially anything that produces physical and psychological
   stress is a threat to sleep health, and these stressors tend to be more
   prevalent in Black communities.

   In the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Healthy People 2030
   plan for the nation, improving health by helping people get enough
   sleep was listed as a goal, with objectives including increasing the
   proportion of adults with sleep apnea symptoms getting evaluated by a
   health care provider and increasing the proportion of schools that
   start later in the mornings. Improving sleep health has been a national
   objective in the federal government’s past two Healthy People programs,
   noted Caraballo-Cordovez, who is not involved in the programs.

   But he added that “the impact of strategies focused on improving sleep
   knowledge and habits – although important and necessary – may be
   limited if they do not address the persistent barriers that
   disproportionally prevent Black individuals from achieving and
   maintaining a healthy life.”
