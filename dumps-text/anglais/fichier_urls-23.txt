   workers and they all were from Africa and Asia. These people did not
   have any rights. The culture of racial discrimination continued for
   such a long time that it became embedded in the people's minds. Now its
   very natural for the people to see other races as unworthy and down.
   Many Indians have also faced a lot of problems in the past due to the
   racial abuse. The people do not get promotions in their jobs and they
   do not get equal salary as their white counterparts. Some are even
   subjected to violence. Lot of Indian Sikhs have been murdered and at
   the receiving end of physical abuse in the USA.

   been going down!

   century, and ... In the view of the U.S. Human Rights Network, a
